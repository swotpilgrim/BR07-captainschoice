# Chapter 26: Championship Game

The championship venue was intimidating in a way our home field never was. Neutral ground, state-of-the-art facility, bleachers packed with scouts and families and students from both schools. The kind of stage where careers were made or broken.

I sat on the bench during warmups, methodically taping my ankle with the precision Dr. Morrison had taught me. Each wrap had to be perfect—tight enough for support, loose enough for circulation. My hands were steady despite the adrenaline thrumming through my system.

"How's it feel?" Garrett asked, kneeling beside me.

"Strong. Ready."

He met my eyes, and in that moment of connection, I saw everything we'd built this season—the conflict, the partnership, the feelings we'd finally acknowledged. Tomorrow, everyone would know about us. But today, we were teammates with one goal.

"Let's win this," he said.

"Absolutely."

The referee's whistle called us to the field for the national anthem. I stood with my team, hand over my heart, looking up at the floodlights illuminating the field against the November darkness. This was it. Everything we'd worked for.

The whistle blew.

Bridgewater came out aggressive from the opening kickoff. They'd clearly scouted our defensive formation and were exploiting gaps with quick passing and coordinated runs. Within the first five minutes, they'd taken three shots on goal, Jordan saving two and the third sailing just wide.

"Tighten up the midfield!" Garrett called, directing players into better positioning. "Don't let them thread those passes!"

The adjustment helped, but Bridgewater was relentless. Their striker was fast and technical, their playmaker had excellent vision, and their entire team played with the confidence of a squad that expected to win.

Fifteenth minute, they broke through.

A long pass over our defense caught us pressing too high. Their striker ran onto it with perfect timing, one-on-one with Jordan. He faked right, went left, and slotted the ball into the net.

Bridgewater 1, Oakmont 0.

The crowd from their school erupted. Our side went quieter, nervous energy replacing pre-game confidence.

I watched from the bench, hands clenched into fists. This was why Coach had kept me as a specialized player—my role was set pieces, not open play. But sitting while my team fought back from a deficit was agony.

"Stay patient!" Coach Bradley called. "Execute the game plan!"

The team settled, finding their rhythm again. Garrett organized the midfield, Connor pressed their defense, Derek and our backline tightened their marking. Slowly, possession began to even out.

Thirty-second minute, we earned a free kick twenty-five yards from goal.

Coach looked at me. "Morgan, you're up."

Finally.

I jogged onto the field to mix of cheers and scattered skepticism from the crowd—even here, even now, some people doubted. I blocked it out, focusing on the opportunity in front of me.

Garrett positioned players for the kick. "What do you see?"

I surveyed the defensive wall, looking for gaps. "Wall is packed tight on the right side. If I can curve it left with enough pace, Connor can get a head on it."

"Do it."

I placed the ball, stepped back, visualized the trajectory. Approached, planted, struck.

The ball curved beautifully around the wall's left edge. Connor timed his run perfectly, meeting it with his forehead and redirecting it powerfully toward the goal.

The goalkeeper dove, fingertips extended—

The ball hit the back of the net.

Goal. 1-1.

Our crowd exploded. Connor grabbed me in celebration, the team piling on. Through the chaos, I found Garrett's eyes across the field. He was smiling, that private smile that meant everything.

We went into halftime tied, both teams having proven they belonged on this stage.

---

The second half was brutal.

Both teams exchanged possession, each denying the other clear opportunities. Physical play increased—hard tackles, aerial challenges, the kind of grinding competition that tests endurance as much as skill.

My ankle ached from the free kick strike, a dull throb that would have worried me yesterday. Today, I barely noticed. Adrenaline and determination overrode any physical discomfort.

Sixtieth minute, Bridgewater earned a corner kick. I watched tensely from the bench as their kicker sent it into our box. Bodies jumped, collided. The ball ricocheted off Derek's shoulder, cleared wide by Jordan's quick reflexes.

Close. Too close.

Sixty-eighth minute, Connor had a breakaway opportunity but the Bridgewater goalkeeper made an impressive save, tipping Connor's shot over the crossbar.

The game felt balanced on a knife's edge. One mistake, one perfect moment, would determine the championship.

Seventy-fifth minute, Garrett drew a foul just outside Bridgewater's penalty area. Not close enough for a direct shot, but perfect position for a corner kick setup.

Coach signaled me in again.

My ankle protested as I jogged onto the field, but I pushed through. This was what I'd rehabbed for. What I'd fought to be cleared for. One more kick could win us the championship.

As I reached the corner flag, Garrett jogged over. Around us, both teams were positioning—our players finding space, Bridgewater's defenders marking tight.

"What do you see?" Garrett asked, trusting my tactical read like he had all season.

I scanned the penalty area. Bridgewater had learned from our first goal, spreading their defensive coverage more evenly. Connor was marked heavily. Derek faced two defenders.

But Jordan...

"Jordan's coming up from goal," I said. "Nobody's tracking him because they don't expect the goalkeeper to attack on a corner."

Garrett looked, saw the same opportunity I did. "Near post?"

"Near post. Quick timing."

He positioned players to sell a far post run while signaling Jordan subtly. Our goalkeeper nodded understanding, moving into position disguised as defensive preparation.

I placed the ball at the corner flag. This was it. Championship game, score tied, everything on the line.

The entire season came down to this kick.

I thought about the first tryout, proving myself worthy of this position. About Garrett's initial resistance and eventual partnership. About the injury that had nearly ended my season. About every obstacle I'd overcome to stand here in this moment.

I didn't just want to make this kick for myself.

I wanted it for Coach Bradley who'd believed in the co-ed innovation. For Kate and Alex who'd supported me. For my parents watching from the stands. For every female athlete who needed to see that barriers could be broken.

For Garrett, who'd become my partner in every sense.

The referee's whistle blew.

I ran my approach, focusing completely on the technical execution. Plant foot, strike with the inside, create the curve needed for the near post run.

The ball arced through the air, curving exactly where I'd intended.

Jordan timed his run perfectly, breaking from the back when defenders were focused on our forwards. He jumped, meeting the ball with his head, redirecting it with power and precision.

The goalkeeper dove too late, the ball already past him.

Net. Goal. 2-1.

The stadium erupted—our crowd screaming, Bridgewater's side groaning. But all I saw was Jordan running toward me, the entire team converging in celebration.

Garrett reached me first, lifting me off the ground briefly before remembering we were on public display. But his eyes said everything: *We did it. Together.*

"Fifteen minutes," he said as the celebration subsided. "Fifteen minutes to hold this lead."

They were the longest fifteen minutes of my life.

Bridgewater threw everything forward, desperate to equalize. Wave after wave of attacks. Our defense held strong—Derek making crucial tackles, Jordan saving shots, Garrett organizing the backline with captain's authority.

Eighty-ninth minute, Bridgewater earned a free kick in dangerous territory. Their kicker stepped up, struck it powerfully toward the upper corner.

Jordan dove full extension, fingertips just reaching the ball, tipping it over the crossbar.

Save of the game.

The final whistle felt like it would never come.

When it finally did—shrill and definitive—the sound was the most beautiful thing I'd ever heard.

Champions.

We'd won.

The field became chaos—teammates piling on each other, coaches running to join the celebration, our crowd pouring toward the field barriers. I was swept up in it, hugged and congratulated by everyone, my ankle forgotten in the overwhelming joy of victory.

Through the chaos, I found Garrett. Our eyes met across the celebrating crowd, and the smile he gave me was pure happiness.

We were champions.

And tomorrow, everyone could know what we'd become to each other.

But right now, in this perfect moment of victory, we were teammates who'd achieved something extraordinary together.

I'd proven I belonged.

We'd won the championship.

And the best part?

This was just the beginning.
