# Chapter 18: Vulnerability

The kick went wrong the moment my foot connected with the ball.

I knew it instantly—the contact felt off, the angle too shallow, the follow-through disrupted by a half-second of hesitation. The ball sailed high instead of curving low, clearing the defensive wall but also clearing Connor's perfectly timed run. It flew harmlessly over the goal and into the crowd behind.

Wasted opportunity.

We still won the away game against Riverside Prep, 3-1, but that didn't erase the sting of my mistake. It was my first significant technical error in six games, and I felt it like a physical weight as I climbed onto the team bus for the two-hour ride back to Oakmont.

Around me, my teammates celebrated the win. Connor was loudly recounting his second goal with elaborate hand gestures. Jordan had his headphones in, already reviewing game film on his laptop. Derek actually smiled at something one of the sophomore defenders said, his mood improved by the decisive victory.

I slid into an empty seat near the back and pulled out my own laptop, queuing up the game footage the assistant coach had already uploaded. I needed to see exactly what I'd done wrong, analyze the mechanics of the failure, understand how to prevent it from happening again.

The bus engine rumbled to life and we pulled away from Riverside's athletic complex. Through my window, I watched their field disappear, replaced by highway and early evening darkness.

"Reviewing the free kick?"

I looked up to find Garrett standing in the aisle beside my seat. He was still in his game jersey, grass stains on his shorts, hair damp from the quick post-game shower.

"Yeah." I gestured to my laptop screen, frozen on the moment before my kick. "Trying to figure out what went wrong."

"We won," Garrett said.

"Doesn't mean I played perfectly."

He was quiet for a moment, then: "Mind if I sit?"

I glanced around the bus. There were other empty seats, places he could sit with Connor or Jordan or the other seniors. But I shifted my bag to the floor, making room.

Garrett dropped into the seat beside me, close enough that our shoulders almost touched in the narrow space. He smelled like grass and sweat and the particular scent of athletic effort, familiar and somehow comforting.

"You're being too hard on yourself," he said, looking at my laptop screen.

"I hesitated. Right before the kick, I second-guessed my read of the defense and adjusted my approach angle. That's what threw off the contact."

"One imperfect kick in six games. Your success rate is still better than any specialist we've had."

I pulled my knees up, wrapping my arms around them despite the awkward position in the bus seat. "It's different for me."

"How?"

I'd been trying not to think about it, trying to just focus on the win and move forward. But Garrett was looking at me with genuine curiosity, and the words came out before I could stop them.

"When you make a mistake, it's just a mistake. When I make a mistake, it becomes evidence. Proof that girls don't belong on boys' teams, that the co-ed innovation was a failure, that I only got my spot because of politics and not merit." I gestured at my laptop. "One bad kick, and everything I've proven gets questioned again."

Garrett was quiet for a long moment. Outside the bus windows, Pennsylvania countryside rolled past in the gathering dark. The bus rumbled steadily beneath us, carrying us home.

"I never thought about it that way," he finally said. "That extra layer of pressure."

"Most people don't." I tried to keep my voice neutral, stating fact rather than accusation. "It's not your fault. You get to be an individual player who has good games and bad games. I have to represent an entire gender every time I step on the field."

"That's not fair."

"No," I agreed. "But it's reality."

Garrett shifted in his seat, angling toward me. "Can I tell you something I've never told anyone else on the team?"

I looked at him, surprised by the sudden vulnerability in his voice. "Okay."

"Two years ago, when I was a sophomore, I played in the state championship game. My brother had won it the year before, so the pressure was enormous to continue the Hayes legacy." He stared at the seat back in front of us, but I could tell he was seeing that game, reliving it. "Tied game, final minutes. I had a clear shot from eighteen yards out. Perfect setup, exactly the kind of opportunity I'd converted a hundred times in practice."

He paused, jaw tight.

"I missed," he said quietly. "Shanked it wide right. Embarrassing, amateur mistake. We lost in overtime. I cost us the championship."

I couldn't imagine Garrett missing a crucial shot. He was always so controlled, so technically precise.

"Everyone was understanding," he continued. "Coach, my teammates, even my brother. They all said it wasn't my fault, that soccer's a team sport, that one play doesn't determine a game. But I knew. I knew I'd had the chance to win and I'd failed."

"Is that why you're so driven this year?" I asked softly.

"Partly. That failure still motivates me. Every game, every practice, I remember what it felt like to let everyone down. To be the weak link when it mattered most." He turned to look at me directly. "What I'm saying is, I understand feeling like you carry extra weight. Maybe different reasons, but I get the pressure of feeling like one mistake defines you."

Something in my chest loosened. Not completely—my frustration with my technical error still burned—but enough that I could breathe a little easier.

"Thanks for telling me that," I said.

"Thanks for being honest about what you're carrying." Garrett's voice was low, intimate in a way that made me hyperaware of how close we were sitting. "For what it's worth, anyone who questions your abilities after one imperfect kick is an idiot who doesn't understand soccer. Your body of work speaks for itself."

"Logically, I know that."

"But emotionally it still sucks."

"Yeah." I managed a small smile. "It does."

We sat in silence for a while. Around us, the bus noise continued—conversations and laughter, someone's music leaking through headphones, the steady road rumble. But in our seat, there was a bubble of quiet understanding.

"You changed how I think about leadership," Garrett said eventually.

I looked at him, surprised. "What?"

"Before you joined the team, I thought being captain meant controlling everything. Making all the decisions, having all the answers, never showing weakness." He ran his hand through his hair—that gesture I'd come to recognize as his tell for working through something complicated. "But watching you handle the pressure of being the first, of representing more than just yourself, of proving yourself over and over with grace and skill... it showed me that real strength isn't about control."

"What is it about?" I asked quietly.

"Courage. Showing up even when it's hard. Doing your job excellently even when people are looking for you to fail. Admitting when you're struggling but not letting it stop you." His gray eyes met mine, and the intensity there made my heart stutter. "You've taught me more about leadership than I've taught anyone as captain."

The words hit me square in the chest. All season, I'd been trying to earn Garrett's respect, to prove I belonged alongside him. And now he was telling me I'd already earned more than that—I'd earned his admiration.

"I think you're giving me too much credit," I managed.

"I don't think I'm giving you enough."

We were staring at each other now, the laptop forgotten on my knees. The bus felt very small suddenly, our seat a private world despite being surrounded by teammates. I was aware of every detail—the way Garrett's shoulder pressed against mine, the steady rise and fall of his breathing, the small scar above his eyebrow, the exact shade of gray in his eyes.

The way he was looking at me like I was something precious and surprising.

"Riley—" he started, voice rough.

"We should probably both try to sleep," I interrupted, suddenly panicked by whatever he'd been about to say. "Long ride back."

Something flickered in Garrett's expression—disappointment? relief?—before he nodded. "Yeah. You're right."

But he didn't move to a different seat. And I didn't ask him to.

Instead, we sat together in comfortable silence as the bus carried us through the Pennsylvania night. Eventually my laptop dimmed into sleep mode, the screen going dark. Outside, scattered lights from small towns appeared and disappeared. Inside, most of the team gradually quieted, settling into travel exhaustion.

At some point, my head drifted sideways, coming to rest on Garrett's shoulder. It happened so naturally I didn't realize until I felt him shift slightly, adjusting to support my weight more comfortably.

I should sit up. Should maintain proper distance. Should remember that we were teammates and nothing more, that I'd come to Oakmont for soccer and scholarships, not for whatever this was becoming.

But Garrett's shoulder was solid and warm, and his breathing had evened out into something steady and peaceful, and I was so tired from the game and the emotional weight of the conversation.

So I stayed there, letting myself have this one moment of comfort.

And when I felt Garrett's head come to rest gently against the top of mine, I didn't pull away.

---

I woke when the bus pulled into Oakmont's parking lot, the sudden stillness jarring after hours of highway rumble. Around us, teammates stirred, gathering bags and equipment.

Garrett and I separated quickly, both suddenly too aware of how we'd been sleeping. My face felt hot in the dark bus.

"Thanks," I said quietly as we stood, shouldering our bags. "For what you said earlier. About the championship game."

"Thanks for being honest," Garrett replied. "About the pressure you carry."

We filed off the bus with everyone else, stepping into the crisp October night. The campus was quiet, most students already in their dorms for the evening. The team dispersed quickly, everyone heading to their respective buildings.

Kate was waiting for me in our room, full of questions about the game, but I begged exhaustion and headed straight for the shower. Under the hot water, I replayed the conversation with Garrett, the vulnerability in his voice when he'd shared his failure, the intensity in his eyes when he'd called me courageous.

The way it had felt to fall asleep on his shoulder.

The way I hadn't wanted to pull away.

This was getting complicated in ways I hadn't anticipated when I'd tried out for the boys' team.

And the scariest part?

I wasn't sure I wanted it to be simple anymore.
