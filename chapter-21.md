# Chapter 21: Dark Night

"Moderate ankle sprain, grade two," Dr. Morrison said, looking up from his examination. "At least two weeks before you can put full weight on it. Three weeks before you're cleared for contact sports."

The words hit me like a physical blow. I sat on the examination table in the team doctor's office, my ankle still swollen despite a night of elevation and ice, and processed what he was telling me.

"The championship game is three weeks away," I said carefully.

"I'm aware." Dr. Morrison's expression was sympathetic but firm. "If your rehabilitation goes perfectly—and I mean perfectly—I might be able to clear you for that game. But there are no guarantees, Riley. Push too hard too fast, and you'll cause permanent damage."

"What are the odds?"

He hesitated. "Honestly? Fifty-fifty. Maybe less. This is a significant sprain. The ligaments need time to heal properly."

I nodded, not trusting myself to speak. Through the window of his office, I could see the practice fields where my team would be training this afternoon. Without me.

"I'm prescribing physical therapy starting in three days," Dr. Morrison continued. "Rest, ice, compression, elevation until then. Absolutely no weight-bearing activity. After that, we'll begin gentle rehabilitation exercises." He handed me a printout with instructions. "Follow this exactly. No shortcuts."

"Understood."

"Riley." He waited until I met his eyes. "You've accomplished something remarkable this season. Don't jeopardize your long-term health trying to rush back. College soccer has four years ahead of you. Don't sacrifice that for three weeks."

I took the printout and left, crutches awkward under my arms. The hallway felt too long, the stairs a humiliating challenge. Other students stared as I navigated campus.

By the time I reached my dorm, I was exhausted.

Kate was in class, which meant I was alone.

I locked the door, dropped the crutches, and collapsed onto my bed.

And finally let myself fall apart.

---

The tears came hot and angry, born from frustration and fear and the crushing weight of helplessness. I'd worked so hard—fought through tryouts, endured Garrett's initial hostility, proved myself game after game. I'd earned my place on this team, earned respect from my teammates, earned recruitment interest from college scouts.

And now I was sidelined.

Useless.

A liability instead of an asset.

The championship game was three weeks away. The game that would determine everything—our season, my recruitment opportunities, Garrett's scholarship chances. The culmination of everything we'd worked toward.

And I might miss it.

Not because I wasn't good enough. Not because I'd made a mistake or failed to perform. But because some player on a rival team had decided undercutting my legs was an acceptable tactic.

I pressed my face into my pillow, trying to muffle the sobs. My ankle throbbed, my shoulders ached from the crutches, my chest felt tight.

But worse than the physical pain was the emotional devastation.

What if I couldn't play in the championship? What if my last memory of this season was being carried off the field, injured and unable to help my team?

What if people remembered me not as the first female player to succeed on a boys' varsity team, but as the girl who got hurt and couldn't handle it?

The thoughts spiraled, each one worse than the last, feeding my fear and frustration until I was crying so hard I couldn't breathe properly.

I didn't hear the knock on the door at first.

When it came again, louder and more insistent, I tried to pull myself together. Wiped my face with my sleeve, tried to steady my breathing.

"Riley? It's me."

Garrett's voice.

I sat up, panic cutting through the misery. "You can't be here. It's quiet hours, boys aren't allowed in the girls' dorm."

"I got permission from the RA. She made an exception." A pause. "Please let me in."

I should send him away. Should tell him I was fine and needed to rest.

Instead, I limped to the door and opened it.

Garrett took one look at my face—red and swollen from crying, eyes still wet with tears—and his expression crumbled.

"Riley," he said softly.

And just hearing him say my name with such gentleness made the tears start again.

He came inside quickly, closing the door behind him, and before I could say anything, he was guiding me back to my bed, supporting my weight so I didn't have to balance on my injured ankle.

"Sit," he said. "Tell me what the doctor said."

I sank onto the bed, and he sat beside me, close enough that our shoulders touched. The physical contact was grounding, pulling me back from the edge of complete breakdown.

"Two weeks minimum before I can put weight on it," I said, voice hoarse from crying. "Three weeks before I'm cleared to play. Championship game is three weeks away."

"So you might make it."

"Maybe. Fifty-fifty odds, he said. If everything goes perfectly with rehabilitation." I gestured helplessly at my wrapped ankle. "And if it doesn't, I miss the most important game of the season."

Garrett was quiet for a moment. "That's the worst-case scenario. What's the best case?"

"Best case, I heal perfectly, pass all the medical tests, and get cleared to play with minimal practice time leading up to the game." I heard the bitterness in my voice. "But even then, I'll be coming back from injury. I won't be at full strength. I might be a liability rather than an asset."

"You're never a liability," Garrett said firmly.

"You don't know that. I could re-injure it during the game. Could mess up a crucial kick because I'm favoring the ankle. Could—"

"Riley." Garrett's hand covered mine where it rested on the bed. "Stop catastrophizing."

"I'm being realistic."

"You're spiraling."

He was right, and I hated that he was right. I looked down at our hands, his larger one completely covering mine, warm and solid.

"I worked so hard for this," I whispered. "To prove I belonged, to show I could compete at this level. And now some dirty player takes me out with an illegal foul and everything I've built is in jeopardy."

"Everything you've built is still there," Garrett said quietly. "The respect you've earned, the plays you've made, the games you've helped us win—that doesn't disappear because you're injured for a few weeks. The team knows your value. Coach knows. I know."

"But if I can't play in the championship—"

"Then we'll deal with that if it happens. Right now, your only job is to heal." His hand tightened around mine. "Doctor said maybe you can play, right? That means maybe you can. Focus on that possibility instead of the worst case."

I finally looked up at him. His gray eyes were intense, holding mine with unwavering certainty.

"What if I let everyone down?" I asked, voice breaking on the question.

"You won't."

"You don't know that."

"I know you," Garrett said. "I know you'll follow doctor's orders perfectly because you're disciplined. I know you'll attack physical therapy the same way you attack everything—with complete commitment. I know that if anyone can heal in time to play, it's you."

"And if I don't?"

"Then it won't be because you didn't try hard enough or weren't good enough. It'll be because healing takes time and sometimes the timeline doesn't work out." His voice softened. "Riley, you've already proven yourself beyond any doubt. One injury doesn't change that."

"It feels like it changes everything," I admitted.

"I know." Garrett shifted closer, and I felt his other hand come up to cup my face, thumb brushing away a tear that had escaped. "When you went down during that game, when you didn't get up right away—I've never been that scared. Not about soccer, not about anything. I realized in that moment that you matter more to me than this season, than championships, than anything."

My breath caught. "Garrett—"

"I care about you, Riley. Not just as a teammate. As someone important to me personally." His eyes searched mine. "Seeing you hurt destroys me. Seeing you cry destroys me. I wish I could fix this, but I can't. All I can do is sit here and tell you that you're not alone."

The tears came again, but different now. Not from fear and frustration, but from overwhelming emotion at his words, at his presence, at the tenderness in his voice.

"I care about you too," I managed. "That's part of why this is so hard. I don't want to let you down. Let the team down."

"You haven't. You won't." Garrett pulled me into a hug, careful of my injured ankle, and I buried my face in his shoulder. "We'll get through this together."

I let myself cry then—not the angry, desperate sobs from before, but quieter tears of release and relief. Garrett held me through it, one hand rubbing slow circles on my back, the other cradling my head against his shoulder.

"I hate being helpless," I said eventually, voice muffled against his shirt.

"You're not helpless. You're healing." He pulled back enough to look at me. "There's a difference."

We sat there for a long moment, his hands still framing my face, my hands gripping his forearms for balance. The space between us felt charged with everything we'd been dancing around for weeks.

"Thank you," I whispered. "For coming here. For staying."

"Always," Garrett said simply.

He stayed until my tears stopped completely, until my breathing evened out and exhaustion from the emotional breakdown started pulling me toward sleep. Only then did he carefully help me get situated on my bed, propped pillows under my ankle for elevation, made sure my pain medication was within reach on the nightstand.

"Text me if you need anything," he said at the door. "I mean it. Any time, day or night."

"You'll get in trouble if you keep sneaking into the girls' dorm."

"Worth it," he said, with a small smile that made my chest ache in an entirely different way.

After he left, I lay in the gathering darkness of my room, staring at the ceiling. My ankle still throbbed. The uncertainty about the championship still loomed. The fear about my recovery timeline still existed.

But I felt less alone than I had since the injury.

Garrett's words echoed in my mind: *I care about you. You're not alone. We'll get through this together.*

Maybe he was right.

Maybe I didn't have to carry this fear by myself.

Maybe together, we could face whatever came next.

I fell asleep with my hand still warm from where Garrett had held it, and for the first time since the injury, I didn't dream of falling.
