# Chapter 23: Forward Together

The secrecy was harder than I'd expected.

Garrett and I had good reasons for waiting until after championship to go public. But now that we'd acknowledged our feelings, everything felt different. And we had to pretend nothing had changed.

"You're smiling at your cereal," Kate observed Tuesday morning. "Thinking about a certain team captain?"

I quickly schooled my expression. "Physical therapy progress."

"Uh-huh." Kate grinned. "I'm happy for you. Just try to be less obvious."

"Was I obvious?"

"You've been staring at the doorway for ten minutes."

I forced myself to focus on my breakfast instead of watching for Garrett. Kate was right—I needed to be more careful. The dining hall was full of students, any of whom could notice if I spent too much time looking in Garrett's direction.

When he did arrive with Connor and Jordan, I allowed myself one quick glance. Our eyes met across the room, and the smile he gave me was small, private, just for me. Then he turned to his teammates and I turned back to Kate, both of us maintaining proper distance.

But I felt that smile like warmth spreading through my chest.

"This is going to be a long three weeks," Kate said knowingly.

She had no idea.

Physical therapy became the highlight of my day because Garrett showed up afterward like clockwork.

"Range of motion improving significantly," my therapist said Thursday. "Healing faster than expected."

"Fast enough to play in two and a half weeks?"

"Let's focus on today's progress."

After the session, Garrett waited in his usual spot with my favorite sandwich and history notes I'd missed.

"You didn't have to bring me lunch," I said, accepting both gratefully.

"I wanted to." He fell into step beside me as we headed outside. "Besides, this way I get to eat with you."

We'd developed a routine over the past week—after physical therapy, we'd find a quiet spot on campus where we could talk without the entire school watching. Today it was the bench near the library's back entrance, secluded enough for privacy but public enough not to raise eyebrows.

"How's the team looking?" I asked between bites of my sandwich.

"Good. Connor's getting better at corner kicks, but he still doesn't have your precision." Garrett opened his own lunch. "We won yesterday's game against Fairmont Prep, but it was closer than it should have been. We're missing your set piece contributions."

"Two and a half weeks until championship. I have to be ready."

"You will be." His hand found mine between us on the bench, hidden from view by the position of our bodies. "Therapist says you're ahead of schedule."

"Ahead of the minimum healing timeline. Not necessarily ahead of the 'ready to play competitive soccer' timeline."

Garrett squeezed my hand. "One day at a time."

It had become his mantra over the past week—when I got frustrated with slow progress or anxious about the championship timeline, he'd pull me back to focusing on today's improvements rather than tomorrow's uncertainties.

"Kate thinks we're being obvious," I said.

"Connor knows something's up. He keeps making comments about my improved mood." Garrett's thumb traced circles on the back of my hand, a gesture I was coming to associate with comfort and affection. "I haven't confirmed anything, but he's perceptive."

"Do you think anyone else suspects?"

"Probably. But suspecting and knowing are different things." He shifted closer, our shoulders touching. "After championship, we can tell everyone. Until then, we just have to be careful."

"I hate being careful," I admitted. "I want to sit with you at team meals. Want to study together in the library without worrying who's watching. Want to actually hold your hand in public."

"Me too." Garrett's voice was low, meant only for me. "But we're protecting what you've built. Making sure no one can question that you earned your place based on merit alone."

He was right. I knew he was right. But that didn't make the secrecy easier.

We finished lunch and I headed back toward my dorm, Garrett returning to the athletics building for afternoon practice. As we parted ways, our fingers lingered together for a moment longer than necessary before we separated into our separate worlds.

Friday afternoon, I sat on the bench during the team's practice, watching them run through set piece drills. Connor was taking my corner kicks, and while his placement had definitely improved, he still couldn't thread the ball through defensive gaps with the same precision.

"Morgan!"

I looked up to find Derek standing in front of me, water bottle in hand, slightly out of breath from drills.

"Palmer," I acknowledged warily.

We hadn't talked much since my injury beyond brief team interactions. Derek's surprising defense of me after the Millbrook game had shifted something, but we weren't exactly friends.

"How's the ankle?" he asked.

"Healing. Physical therapist says I'm making good progress."

Derek nodded, looking almost uncomfortable. "Good. We need you back for championship."

It was the closest thing to a compliment I'd ever gotten from him.

"Thanks," I said carefully.

"Look." Derek sat on the bench beside me, which was unexpected enough that I tensed slightly. "I was wrong about you. When you first joined the team, I thought it was a publicity stunt. Thought you'd quit after a few hard practices or a rough game. I was an ass about it."

I waited, unsure where this was going.

"But you didn't quit. You proved you belonged here through skill and work ethic. And watching that Millbrook player deliberately injure you made me realize you've been dealing with that kind of crap all season—guys trying to hurt you or intimidate you just because you're female—and you never complained or backed down." He met my eyes directly. "You're tougher than half this team, Morgan. We're lucky to have you."

The admission clearly cost him something, and I appreciated it more than I could articulate.

"Thank you," I said. "That means a lot."

"Just heal up and get back on that field. Connor's corner kicks are garbage compared to yours." Derek stood, heading back to practice. "Also, for what it's worth? Hayes is less of an uptight captain when you're around. Don't know what you did to him, but whatever it is, keep doing it."

He jogged back to drills before I could respond, leaving me sitting there slightly stunned.

Kate was going to love hearing about this.

Saturday afternoon, Kate dragged me to watch the girls' varsity soccer game. I sat in the bleachers with my crutches propped beside me, ankle wrapped but feeling better than it had in days.

Alex found us after the game—they'd won 3-0—and climbed into the bleachers to sit on my other side.

"How's recovery going?" she asked.

"Good. Really good, actually. Physical therapist thinks I might be cleared to play in championship if I keep improving at this rate."

"That's great." Alex hesitated. "Can I ask you something?"

"Sure."

"Do you regret it? Joining the boys' team?"

I considered the question carefully. A month ago, dealing with Garrett's hostility and Derek's resistance and the constant pressure of representing all female athletes, I might have had moments of doubt.

But now?

"No," I said firmly. "It's been harder than I expected in some ways. The scrutiny, the pressure, dealing with players like that Millbrook guy who think injuring me proves I don't belong. But I've grown more this season than I have in years. I've proven—to myself more than anyone—that I can compete at this level. And I've..." I stopped myself before saying too much about Garrett.

"Found something you didn't expect," Alex finished knowingly.

I looked at her sharply. "What do you mean?"

"Riley, I've known you for three years. You've been laser-focused on soccer and scholarships. This semester you've been... different. Happier, despite all the challenges. And I've seen the way you and Hayes look at each other when you think no one's watching."

My face heated. "We're teammates."

"You're more than that." Alex smiled. "And for what it's worth, I think it's good. You deserve to have someone who sees how amazing you are, both as a player and as a person."

"We're keeping it quiet until after championship," I admitted.

"Smart. People are idiots about female athletes having personal lives." She bumped my shoulder gently. "But I'm glad you're happy. You've earned it."

That evening, Garrett appeared at my dorm room door with a textbook and study notes, our cover story for spending time together.

Kate took one look at us and grabbed her own books. "I'll be in the common room if you need me. By which I mean I'll be gone for at least two hours."

After she left, Garrett and I sat on my bed, supposedly studying but mostly just talking.

"Derek talked to me today," I said. "Apologized for being wrong about me. Said I'm tougher than half the team."

Garrett smiled. "You're tougher than the whole team, but I'll take Derek finally recognizing it as progress."

"He also said you're less uptight when I'm around."

"Connor's been saying the same thing." Garrett set aside his textbook, shifting to face me fully. "They're not wrong. You make everything better."

The simple sincerity in his voice made my chest tight.

"Even sitting here doing calculus homework?" I asked lightly.

"Especially that." He leaned in, brushing a soft kiss against my lips. "Though I have to admit, I'm not getting much studying done."

"Me either."

We sat together in comfortable silence, foreheads touching, hands linked between us. Outside my window, campus life continued—students heading to the library, athletes returning from practice, the normal rhythms of Oakmont in mid-semester.

But in my room, it was just us. No team watching, no pressure to maintain distance, no pretending we were just teammates.

Just Riley and Garrett, together.

"Two and a half weeks until championship," Garrett said quietly. "Then everyone can know about us."

"Can't wait," I said.

"Me either." He pulled back, smiling. "But until then, want to actually attempt this calculus homework?"

I laughed. "I suppose we should."

We studied for real then, shoulders touching, occasionally helping each other with difficult problems. It was domestic and comfortable and exactly what I needed.

And when Kate returned two hours later, she found us actually doing homework and gave us both knowing smiles that suggested she saw right through our cover story but approved anyway.

Two and a half weeks until championship.

Two and a half weeks until we could stop hiding.

I could wait that long.

With Garrett beside me, I could wait forever if I had to.
