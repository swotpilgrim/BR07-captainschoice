# Chapter 22: Turning Point

The physical therapy room smelled like antiseptic and rubber mats. Three days post-injury, and I could barely manage basic rehabilitation exercises without pain.

"Good work today," the therapist said. "Ice and elevate when you get back."

I nodded, reaching for the crutches I hated. "Better than expected" progress wasn't the same as "on track to play in three weeks."

I made my way out of the training room.

Garrett was waiting in the hallway.

He'd been here every day since my injury, showing up during my physical therapy sessions like it was the most natural thing in the world. Today he held two bottles of water and wore his practice gear, clearly having come straight from afternoon training.

"How'd it go?" he asked.

"Fine."

"Riley."

I stopped. "It's frustrating, okay? I'm doing ankle rotations while you're out there preparing for crucial games."

"You're healing. It's been three days."

"Exactly. Three days gone, barely any progress."

"The therapist thinks you're doing well."

"At this rate, I'll maybe walk by championship. Forget playing."

Garrett caught my elbow. "Let me help you back to your room."

"I don't need help. I need to play soccer."

"Right now, you need to heal."

I let him guide me outside. We headed toward my dorm in silence.

"How was practice?" I asked eventually.

"Good. Connor's taking set pieces until you're back. He's decent, but we miss your accuracy."

"Decent isn't good enough."

"No," Garrett agreed quietly.

We made it to my room. Kate had left a note—library all afternoon.

Garrett helped me get settled, propping pillows under my ankle, handing me ice packs. All the caretaking gestures that made me feel helpless.

"I hate this," I burst out. "I hate being useless. I hate depending on other people for basic things. I hate sitting on the sidelines while the team prepares without me."

Garrett sat on Kate's desk chair, facing me. "You're not useless."

"I can't even walk without crutches."

"For now."

"What if I don't heal in time? What if I miss championship?"

"Riley—"

"What if I cost us the game because I came back too soon?"

"You're catastrophizing."

"I'm being realistic!" My voice sharpened. "You keep saying everything will be fine, but you don't know that. Nobody knows if I'll be ready."

Garrett stood, moved to sit on the edge of my bed, close enough that I could see the concern in his gray eyes. "You're right. I don't know if you'll be ready for championship. Neither do you. Neither does the doctor. We won't know until we get there."

"Then why do you keep acting like it's guaranteed?"

"Because I believe in you." His voice was firm, certain. "I've watched you overcome every obstacle this season—my resistance, Derek's hostility, the pressure of being the first, the scrutiny of every mistake. You don't quit. You don't back down. If anyone can come back from this injury in time, it's you."

"What if I can't?" The question came out small, vulnerable. "What if this is the thing that finally breaks me?"

"It won't." Garrett reached out, taking my hand. "You want to know why I'm so sure?"

"Why?"

"Because you're the strongest person I know." His thumb traced circles on the back of my hand, the gesture both comforting and distracting. "Not physically—though you're plenty tough. But mentally, emotionally. You showed up to tryouts knowing half the school would judge you. You joined a team where the captain openly resented you. You faced hostile crowds and dirty players and constant pressure to represent more than just yourself. And you did it with grace and skill and courage."

I couldn't look away from his eyes, from the intensity there.

"One injury doesn't erase that strength," Garrett continued. "It doesn't change who you are or what you've already accomplished. You're allowed to be frustrated right now. Hell, you'd be weird if you weren't. But don't mistake temporary helplessness for permanent weakness."

My throat felt tight. "You really believe that?"

"I know it." He squeezed my hand. "You taught me more about real strength this season than anyone else ever has."

"I'm sitting here crying about physical therapy exercises," I pointed out.

"You're sitting here facing your fear and frustration instead of pretending it doesn't exist. That's honest. That's brave." Garrett's voice softened. "Riley, you don't have to be perfect all the time. You don't have to be strong every second. You're allowed to have moments where you're scared or angry or overwhelmed."

"Even though the team needs me?"

"Especially then. Being human doesn't make you less valuable to the team. It makes you real."

I looked down at our joined hands, his larger one completely enveloping mine. "Why do you care so much?"

The question hung in the air between us. Garrett went very still.

"I mean," I continued, not quite brave enough to look at him, "you've been here every day. During physical therapy, bringing me food when I can't make it to the dining hall, stocking my mini-fridge, helping me with basic tasks. Why?"

"You know why."

"Do I?"

Garrett was quiet for so long I finally looked up. His expression was unguarded, vulnerable in a way I'd never seen before.

"Because somewhere between resenting your presence on my team and respecting your skill," he said slowly, "I fell for you. Completely."

My heart stopped. Then started again, too fast, pounding against my ribs.

"I tried not to," Garrett continued. "Tried to keep it professional, keep my distance. Told myself you came here for soccer, not to deal with romantic complications from your captain. But then you'd make some tactical observation that perfectly complemented my strategic thinking, or you'd nail a corner kick with that focused intensity you get, or you'd make some dry comment that made me laugh when I was stressed. And I'd realize I was in way over my head."

"Garrett—"

"The injury terrified me," he admitted. "Not because the team needs you for set pieces—though we do. But because seeing you hurt made me realize how much you mean to me personally. How much I care about you beyond soccer, beyond the team, beyond any of the reasons I should care."

I couldn't speak. Couldn't breathe. Could only stare at him as he laid out feelings I'd been trying not to hope for.

"I know the timing is terrible," Garrett said. "I know you're dealing with injury and recovery and pressure about championship. I know this complicates things. But you asked why I care so much, and that's why. Because I fell for you, Riley. And I can't pretend I didn't."

The silence stretched between us, weighted with everything changing.

"I've been fighting my feelings," I finally managed. "Telling myself I came here for soccer, for scholarships, for my future. That I couldn't afford to be distracted by anything—anyone—else."

Garrett's face shuttered slightly, preparing for rejection.

"But the truth is," I continued, tightening my grip on his hand, "I fell for you too. Somewhere between you apologizing for your initial hostility and us designing that free kick play together. Between studying in the library and falling asleep on your shoulder on the bus. Between every moment you challenged me to think deeper or supported me when things got hard."

"Riley—"

"I fought it because I was scared. Scared it would complicate the team dynamic. Scared people would say I only got to play because the captain liked me. Scared of wanting something beyond soccer when soccer was supposed to be everything."

"And now?" Garrett's voice was rough, hopeful.

"Now I'm still scared," I admitted. "But I'm more scared of losing you by never being honest about how I feel."

The smile that broke across Garrett's face was like sunrise—slow, brilliant, transforming. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

He leaned forward, and for one breathless moment I thought he might kiss me. But instead, he rested his forehead against mine, eyes closed, breathing carefully controlled.

"We should probably talk about this," he said. "About what it means, how we handle it."

"Probably." I closed my own eyes, savoring the closeness. "What are you thinking?"

"That I want to be with you. Really with you, not just teammates or friends." He pulled back enough to look at me. "But I also think we should keep it quiet until after championship."

"Why?"

"Because you were right to worry about people questioning whether you earned your spot. If we go public now, some people will say that's why you're on the team. But if we wait until after championship—after you've played the entire season and contributed to whatever outcome we achieve—no one can question that your position was based on merit."

I considered this. "You've thought about it."

"I've thought about little else for weeks." A rueful smile. "Trying to figure out if there was any way to be with you without putting you in a position where people could diminish your accomplishments."

The fact that he'd been worrying about protecting my reputation before even telling me his feelings said everything about who Garrett Hayes was.

"Okay," I said. "We keep it quiet until after championship. Private for now."

"But real," Garrett confirmed. "This is real, even if it's secret for a few more weeks."

"Real," I agreed.

He smiled, and this time when he leaned in, his lips met mine.

The kiss was gentle, careful, mindful of my injury and the newness of this thing between us. But it was also achingly sincere, a physical confirmation of everything we'd just confessed.

When we pulled apart, we were both smiling.

"So," I said. "Guess we're doing this."

"Guess we are." Garrett settled more comfortably on my bed, his hand still holding mine. "How's your ankle feeling?"

I laughed, surprised by the mundane question after such an emotional conversation. "Still hurts. But somehow less catastrophic than it did an hour ago."

"Good." He reached for the ice pack that had slipped. "Because you're going to heal, you're going to play in championship, and we're going to win. And then everyone can know about us."

"Confident."

"About you? Always."

We sat together as afternoon faded toward evening, talking about everything and nothing—recovery timelines and college recruitment and what came after championship. Making plans we could finally make together instead of separately.

And for the first time since the injury, I felt something other than fear about the future.

I felt hope.
