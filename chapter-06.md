# Chapter 6: Cold Shoulder

The pattern established itself over the next week.

Tuesday's practice, I arrived to find the team in their usual clusters. I went through my warmup routine alone until Connor noticed and jogged over.

"You're making me look bad," he said, falling into pace beside me. "I was planning to slack off today."

"Can't help it."

But the truth was, I couldn't afford to slack off. Every moment on this field, I was being evaluated, judged, measured against some invisible standard that kept shifting.

Wednesday's practice included defensive positioning drills. Coach had us working on organization during corner kicks—who marked whom, how to cover different zones, communication between players.

Garrett, as captain, was directing the positioning. "Morgan, you're taking the corner. Defense, set up like we would against Westfield's formation."

I placed the ball and surveyed the setup while the defenders organized themselves. Something looked off—the spacing at the near post created a vulnerable gap.

"The near post is exposed," I called out. "If I drive it low with pace, that gap is wide open."

Garrett's jaw tightened. "The positioning is fine. Execute the kick."

"But—"

"That's not a suggestion, Morgan. It's a tactical decision. Take the kick."

I took the kick, driving it exactly where I'd identified the weakness. The ball sailed through the gap at the near post, unmarked, demonstrating the vulnerability I'd pointed out.

Garrett's expression didn't change. "Again. Defense, adjust spacing."

No acknowledgment that I'd been right. No credit for identifying the weakness. Just move on to the next rep.

Connor caught my eye from his position in the box and gave me a look that said he'd noticed. But he didn't say anything either. Garrett was captain. His tactical calls stood, even when they were wrong.

Thursday after practice, I was heading to the locker area when I heard voices from Coach Bradley's office. The door was slightly ajar, and I recognized Garrett's voice immediately.

"—disrupting team chemistry," he was saying. "The guys don't know how to act around her. It's affecting our cohesion."

I froze in the hallway, just out of sight.

Coach Bradley's response was sharp. "The disruption I'm seeing isn't coming from Morgan's performance, Hayes. It's coming from your attitude."

"My attitude? Coach, I'm trying to—"

"You're trying to control a situation that doesn't need controlling. Morgan shows up, works hard, executes her skills, and integrates professionally. Meanwhile, you're questioning her tactical input during drills and creating an environment where half the team thinks they need to choose sides." Coach's voice carried real frustration. "You're the captain. Your behavior sets the tone. Right now, the tone you're setting is hostile."

Silence. I held my breath, knowing I shouldn't be listening but unable to walk away.

"She's good," Coach continued, quieter now. "You know she's good. I've seen you watch her place corner kicks. You're too smart a player not to recognize elite technique when you see it. So either give me a real reason why you have a problem with her presence, or figure out how to be the captain this team needs."

"Understood, Coach."

The conversation seemed to be over. I quickly moved down the hallway before Garrett could emerge and find me eavesdropping. My heart was pounding—partly from the close call, partly from Coach's words.

She's good. You know she's good.

Even Garrett knew. He just wouldn't admit it.

Friday brought the most obvious exclusion yet. After practice, the team headed to the dining hall. I'd started walking with Jordan and Ben when we reached the team's traditional table near the windows.

"Morgan!" Connor called, gesturing to an empty chair. "Sit here."

I started toward it, but Derek Palmer slid into the seat before I could reach it, sprawling out with his practice bag beside him.

"Sorry," Derek said, not sounding sorry at all. "Spots are saved."

Connor's expression darkened. "Derek, I literally just—"

"It's fine," I said quickly, not wanting to create a scene. "I'll find somewhere else."

I scanned the table. Other players were filing in, filling in the remaining seats. There was technically room—people could squeeze together, make space. But no one offered. Some avoided eye contact. Others looked uncomfortable but didn't speak up.

Garrett sat at the head of the table, watching the entire interaction with an unreadable expression. He said nothing.

"Riley, come on," Jordan said quietly, clearly uncomfortable. "We can make room."

"It's really fine," I said, keeping my voice even. "I need to check in with my roommate anyway."

I turned and walked away before anyone could see how much it stung. Crossed the dining hall to where Kate sat with the girls' soccer team, their familiar faces suddenly feeling like safety.

"Hey," I said, sliding into an empty seat. "Mind if I join you?"

"Of course not." Alex moved her bag to make more room. "You okay?"

"Yeah. Fine."

Kate studied my face, then glanced across the dining hall toward the boys' table. Her expression went cold. "What happened?"

"Nothing. Just grabbing dinner with my actual friends."

But we all knew it wasn't nothing. The girls' team exchanged looks—some angry, some sympathetic. They'd all seen me walk away from the boys' table.

"They're idiots," Kate said fiercely. "You're better than all of them."

"Not helping, Kate."

"I'm serious. You earned your spot. If they can't handle that, it's their problem, not yours."

I appreciated her loyalty, but it was my problem too. I had to practice with these guys every day, had to play with them in games, had to somehow become part of a team that was making it very clear I wasn't welcome at their table.

Saturday's practice was more of the same. During a water break, I overheard Derek talking to another defender.

"—don't know why Coach is forcing this. We had a perfectly good team without the diversity hire."

Diversity hire. Like my skill had nothing to do with it.

I took a long drink of water, refusing to react visibly. Instead, I channeled it into my play. Every set piece opportunity was perfectly placed. When Garrett questioned my positioning during a free kick drill, I demonstrated exactly why my angle was correct.

Silent excellence. My only option.

After practice ended, I stayed on the field. Coach had already left, and most of the team had headed to the locker rooms, but I wasn't ready to leave yet. I grabbed a bag of balls and set up for corner kick practice.

Right corner, near post placement. Left corner, far post curve. Right corner again, driven low with pace. I worked through the variations systematically, my plant leg burning with fatigue but my accuracy staying sharp.

The sun was starting to set, painting the field in orange and gold light. I was completely alone now, just me and the balls and the field that was becoming familiar territory.

"Your technique really is perfect."

I spun around to find Jordan standing at the edge of the field, his goalkeeper gloves in one hand.

"Sorry, didn't mean to startle you," he said. "I was heading out and saw you practicing."

"Just getting some extra reps in."

Jordan walked closer, studying me with that analytical gaze. "You don't need extra reps. Your corner kicks are already the best on the team."

"Can't hurt to be better."

"That's not why you're out here though, is it?" He said it gently, without judgment. "You're trying to be so good that no one can dismiss you."

I didn't answer, which was answer enough.

Jordan was quiet for a moment, then said, "For what it's worth, some of us see what you're doing. How hard you're working, how professionally you're handling... everything. Connor and Ben and I were talking about it. We think Garrett and Derek are being jerks."

"Then why doesn't anyone say anything?" The words came out more sharply than I intended.

"Because Garrett's the captain. Because it's complicated. Because—" He stopped, looking frustrated with himself. "I don't have a good answer. You're right that we should be speaking up more. I'm sorry we're not."

His honesty disarmed my anger. "Thanks for saying that."

"Garrett's under a lot of pressure," Jordan said. "His family's financial situation isn't great—they're barely holding on to their legacy status. He needs a scholarship desperately, and he's terrified something will derail his senior season. I think he sees you as an unknown variable he can't control."

"I'm not trying to derail anything. I'm trying to help the team win."

"I know. And some of us see that." Jordan shifted his gloves to his other hand. "Give it time. Once we start winning games with your contributions, it'll be harder for people to justify the cold shoulder."

"And if we don't win?"

"Then it won't matter anyway, and at least you'll know you gave it your best shot."

After Jordan left, I stayed on the field for another twenty minutes, working through kicks until my leg was shaking with fatigue and the light was fading too much to see clearly.

Walking back across campus, my body exhausted and my mind spinning, I thought about Jordan's words. Give it time. Wait for the wins to speak for themselves.

But time felt like something I didn't have much of. Every practice where Garrett ignored my input, every meal where there was no room at the table, every snide comment from Derek—they all added up, wearing away at my determination like water on stone.

Back in my dorm room, Kate took one look at my face and pulled me into a hug.

"Bad day?"

"Just tired."

"Liar. But I'll let it go." She headed to her desk. "For the record, the entire girls' team wants to kick Derek Palmer's ass."

Despite everything, I smiled. "Please don't start a war on my behalf."

"Too late. We're already planning our assault."

I flopped onto my bed. Tomorrow was Sunday—no practice, a day to recover. Then Monday we'd start preparing for Saturday's game.

My first real game. My first chance to prove I belonged.

I needed to be ready. Mentally ready to perform under pressure, to execute perfectly even with a captain who'd rather I wasn't there.

I closed my eyes and tried to visualize success. Perfect corner kicks, the crowd cheering, feeling like I actually belonged.

It was harder to visualize than it should have been.
