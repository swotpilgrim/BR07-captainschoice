# Chapter 17: Off-Field Connection

The library had become our unintentional meeting place. We both studied there most evenings after practice, and eventually it seemed silly to sit at separate tables when we had the same history essay due Friday.

"You can't seriously argue that economic factors were secondary to political ideology," Garrett said, flipping through his textbook. "The whole conflict was rooted in trade disputes."

I tapped my pen against my notebook. "Trade disputes that existed because of fundamentally different political philosophies. The economics were a symptom, not the cause."

We'd been debating the essay prompt for twenty minutes. Turned out Garrett approached academics the same way he approached soccer—with complete commitment and zero tolerance for sloppy thinking.

"You're wrong," he said, but there was a hint of a smile at the corner of his mouth.

"You're stubborn," I countered.

"That's rich, coming from you."

I leaned back in my chair, studying him across the table. We'd spread our books and notes across the entire surface, creating a shared workspace that felt comfortable in a way I hadn't expected. "Fine. What if we're both right? What if the economic and political factors were interconnected and reinforced each other?"

Garrett considered this, his hand automatically moving to run through his hair—the gesture I'd noticed in the library last week and couldn't seem to stop noticing now. "That's actually not a bad thesis. You'd need to structure it carefully to avoid the argument becoming too broad."

"Obviously." I pulled my notebook closer, already sketching an outline. "Three main points, each one examining a specific intersection of economic and political factors..."

As I wrote, I felt Garrett's eyes on me. When I glanced up, he was watching me with an expression I couldn't quite read.

"What?"

"Nothing. Just..." He shook his head. "You get the same look when you're working through an essay structure as you do when you're reading a defense before a kick. Completely focused."

Heat crept up my neck. "So do you. The hair thing gives you away."

"Hair thing?"

"You run your hand through your hair when you're thinking hard about something. You do it during film study too."

Garrett's hand, which had been halfway to his hair, froze. Then he laughed—a genuine sound that made something warm unfold in my chest. "Guess I have a tell."

"Everyone does." I turned back to my notes before I could say something dangerous like *I've been cataloging yours for weeks now*.

We worked in comfortable silence for a while, the scratching of pens and turning of pages creating a rhythm between us. Around us, the library slowly emptied as it got later, students heading back to dorms before curfew.

"My roommate thinks I'm spending too much time studying," Garrett said eventually, breaking the quiet.

"Kate thinks I'm using studying as an excuse."

"An excuse for what?"

I kept my eyes on my notebook. "She has theories. Most of them wrong."

"Connor has theories too." Garrett's voice was carefully neutral. "Also probably wrong."

We didn't look at each other. We didn't have to. The awareness hung between us, unspoken but impossible to ignore.

Saturday afternoon was unseasonably warm for late October, one of those gift days before winter arrived. No practice meant rare free time.

I was lacing up my running shoes on the front steps when Garrett appeared, already in running gear.

"Trail run?" he asked, like it was the most natural question in the world.

My heart did something complicated. "Sure. The five-mile loop?"

"Unless you can't keep up," he said, with a challenging grin that reminded me exactly why I'd found him so infuriating two months ago.

Also why I found him so compelling now.

We started easy, following the wooded trail that circled Oakmont's property. Fallen leaves crunched underfoot, the air crisp with autumn and woodsmoke.

For the first mile, we didn't talk much, settling into a rhythm together. Garrett had a longer stride, but I was quicker, and we matched pace naturally. Running beside someone was different—you became aware of their breathing, their footfalls, the space between you.

"Your form's good," Garrett said as we climbed a gentle hill. "You run a lot?"

"Every morning before breakfast. Conditioning." I glanced at him. "You?"

"Same. Usually with Connor, but he's visiting his sister this weekend."

We crested the hill and the trail opened onto a vista overlooking Oakmont below. We slowed to a walk, catching our breath. The academic buildings clustered together, brick and ivy and tradition. Beyond them, the athletic fields spread out like green squares.

"Four years here," Garrett said quietly. "Feels like forever and no time at all."

"You'll miss it," I said.

"Yeah." He was quiet for a moment. "My dad wanted me to go here. He came here, my grandfather came here. My brother. It's the Hayes legacy school."

There was something in his voice that made me look at him more closely. "That's a lot of pressure."

"Different than yours, but yeah. Pressure." He started walking again, following the trail as it curved back into the woods. "My dad's business hasn't been doing well the past few years. Not badly enough that we're struggling, but badly enough that soccer scholarships matter a lot more than anyone wants to admit."

I'd suspected something like that, but hearing him say it out loud felt significant. Like he was trusting me with something real.

"My parents never went to college," I said, matching his honesty. "Dad coaches youth soccer, Mom's a nurse. They work hard, but there's not extra money for tuition. If I want to play college soccer, I need a scholarship. Full ride, preferably."

"That's why you tried out for the boys' team."

"Better resources, better coaching, more scouts at games." I kicked at a pile of leaves. "The girls' program is good, but it's not equal. Not in funding, not in attention. I needed the advantage."

"You got it," Garrett said. "Coach told me three different schools have asked about you specifically."

I stopped walking. "What?"

"You didn't know?" He turned to face me, surprise clear in his expression. "Bradley's been fielding recruitment calls. Schools saw the newspaper article, watched game film. They're interested."

Joy and relief flooded through me so intensely I had to blink against sudden stinging in my eyes. This was what I'd wanted. What I'd fought for. Proof that joining the boys' team had been the right choice.

"Hey," Garrett said softly, stepping closer. "That's good news. Why do you look like you're going to cry?"

"I'm not going to cry." I swiped at my eyes anyway. "It's just—that's everything. That's the whole reason I did this. To get noticed, to get recruited, to have options."

"You earned it." His voice was firm, certain. "Your performance, your skill. You earned every bit of that attention."

We were standing close now, close enough that I could see the rise and fall of his chest as his breathing steadied, the way the dappled sunlight through the trees caught in his hair, the absolute sincerity in his gray eyes.

"What about you?" I asked, my voice coming out quieter than intended. "Are schools recruiting you?"

"A few. Division II mostly, one Division I program that's rebuilding." He shrugged. "I need a strong finish to the season. Championship would seal it."

"We're going to get there," I said.

"Yeah." He smiled, and it transformed his whole face, erasing the stern captain's expression he wore so often. "Yeah, I think we are."

We stood there another moment, the comfortable silence from the library study session stretching between us again. Then Garrett cleared his throat and stepped back.

"Should finish the run. Still three miles to go."

"Race you to the next marker," I said, already taking off.

His laughter followed me down the trail.

That evening, Kate took one look at me when I walked into our room and pointed at my desk chair. "Sit. Talk. Now."

"I went for a run."

"With Garrett Hayes."

"How did you—"

"Connor's girlfriend saw you two on the trails. Looking 'very cozy,' according to the text she sent me." Kate sat on her bed, facing me with her arms crossed. "Riley. What's happening?"

I slumped in the chair. "I don't know."

"Do you like him?"

I could deflect, make a joke, change the subject. But this was Kate, who'd been my roommate for three years, who already knew the answer.

"Yes," I admitted. "I like him."

"Does he like you?"

"I think so. Maybe. We haven't..." I gestured helplessly. "We're teammates. It's complicated."

"Everything's complicated if you think about it too hard," Kate said. "The question is whether you're going to do anything about it."

"What am I supposed to do? Risk making things weird right when we finally have a good partnership? What if it goes badly and we still have to practice together every day?"

Kate considered this. "Fair points. Counter-argument: what if it goes well?"

I pulled my knees to my chest, wrapping my arms around them. "I came here to play soccer, Kate. To prove I could compete at this level, to get recruited, to earn my scholarship. I didn't come here for a relationship."

"You can do both," Kate said gently. "You're allowed to have more than one thing in your life."

"But what if people think—"

"That you're dating the captain? Some people will always find something to criticize. You've already proven yourself on the field. Your stats speak for themselves. Anyone who thinks you're only playing because of some relationship with Garrett is an idiot who doesn't understand soccer."

She made it sound simple. Maybe it was.

Or maybe I was just too scared to find out.

"For what it's worth," Kate added, "Connor told his girlfriend that Garrett's been 'different lately.' Smiling more, less stressed, actually enjoying practices instead of just grinding through them. Connor thinks it's because of you."

"Connor talks too much."

"Connor's observant." Kate grinned. "And according to him, Garrett talks about you constantly. Your tactical reads, your kick placement, your focus under pressure. If I didn't know better, I'd think the captain has a crush."

"Kate—"

"I'm just saying. You're not the only one noticing things." She flopped back on her bed, looking at the ceiling. "The question is whether either of you is brave enough to actually do something about it."

I didn't have an answer to that.

But as I showered and changed for dinner, as I made my way to the dining hall and saw Garrett already sitting with the team, as our eyes met across the room and he smiled—small, private, just for me—I felt something shift inside my chest.

Kate was right about one thing.

I wasn't the only one noticing.

The question was what we were going to do about it.
