# Chapter 7: Proving Ground

The library was nearly empty Sunday evening, just a handful of students scattered across the study carrels, faces illuminated by laptop screens. I'd claimed one of the individual study rooms on the second floor—the ones with doors that closed and tables big enough to spread out.

My laptop displayed game film from Worthington Academy, our opponent for Saturday's upcoming match. I'd found footage from three of their recent games and was working through it methodically, taking notes on their defensive formations and patterns.

Worthington's back line favored zonal marking during set pieces. The left-side defender tended to cheat toward center, leaving the far post vulnerable. Their wall formation on free kicks was predictable—always four players, same spacing.

I paused and jotted notes: "Far post on corners. Free kicks—curl around right edge of wall."

This was what my dad had taught me. Soccer wasn't just physical execution. It was preparation, studying your opponent, identifying weaknesses.

"That's some serious dedication."

I looked up to find Connor standing in the doorway of the study room, backpack slung over one shoulder and a curious expression on his face.

"Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt," he said. "I was looking for a quiet place to work and saw you through the window. What are you watching?"

"Worthington game film. Analyzing their defensive setup for set pieces."

Connor's eyebrows rose. "You're scouting the opponent? On a Sunday night?"

"Figured it couldn't hurt to be prepared." I gestured to the empty chair across from me. "Want to see what I've found?"

He dropped his backpack and sat down, leaning forward to see the screen. "Show me."

I restarted the video, showing him the corner kick situation I'd been analyzing. "Watch the far post. See how their left defender keeps drifting center? If we can get enough curve on a left-side corner, there's a gap."

Connor watched intently, his player's eye immediately seeing what I was pointing out. "You're right. That's a real weakness. And our forwards are good in the air—we could exploit that."

"Exactly." I clicked to another clip. "And look at this. Their free kick wall. Same formation every time, same spacing. If I can curve it around the right edge with enough pace, we've got a real scoring opportunity."

We spent twenty minutes reviewing footage together, Connor adding his perspective as a forward—where he'd want the ball placed, what runs he could make. His tactical knowledge was solid.

"This is really impressive, Riley," he said finally. "I don't think anyone else on the team is putting in this kind of prep work."

"My dad taught me. He always said the game is won before you step on the field."

"Smart man." Connor studied me for a moment. "Can I ask you something?"

"Sure."

"How are you handling everything? The team dynamics, I mean. Garrett's attitude, Derek being a jerk, the whole situation."

I closed my laptop, considering how honest to be. "It's harder than I expected. I knew there'd be resistance, but I thought once I proved I could actually play, people would come around faster."

"Some people have." Connor gestured to himself. "Jordan, Ben, a few others. We see what you're bringing to the team."

"But the captain doesn't. And that sets the tone for everyone else."

Connor was quiet for a beat, then said, "Garrett's dealing with a lot. I'm not excusing his behavior, just... giving you context."

"What kind of context?"

"His family's financial situation is rough. They're legacy Oakmont—his grandfather, his father, his older brother all went here—but the money's basically gone. They're barely holding on to the image. Garrett's here on partial scholarship, needs a full ride to afford college. His brother got one to a decent Division I program, and Garrett feels like he has to match that or he's failed."

I absorbed this information, fitting it together with what I already knew. "So his senior season is make or break."

"Exactly. And he sees you as a variable he can't control. What if the media attention on the co-ed thing overshadows the team's performance? What if scouts come to see the 'girl kicker' instead of scouting him? What if it disrupts team chemistry and costs them wins?"

"Those are all things that might not happen," I pointed out. "He's decided I'm a problem before giving me a real chance."

"You're right. He's being unfair." Connor ran a hand through his hair. "I've known Garrett since freshman year. He's normally a good guy, a solid captain. But the pressure is making him act like someone he's not."

"Pressure doesn't excuse treating people badly."

"No, it doesn't. You're absolutely right about that." Connor met my eyes. "For what it's worth, I think you're handling it with way more grace than I would. And I think once we start winning games with your contributions, Garrett will have to acknowledge you're an asset, not a liability."

"You really think that will change things?"

"Performance is the only language some people understand. Show them you make the team better, and they'll have to respect it. Or they'll look like idiots to everyone else."

After Connor left to actually do his homework, I stayed in the study room for another hour, finishing my film analysis and compiling notes on Worthington's weaknesses. When I finally packed up and headed back to my dorm, I felt more prepared, more in control.

I couldn't change Garrett's attitude directly. But I could prepare so thoroughly that my performance spoke louder than his skepticism.

Monday's practice was crisp and focused. Coach Bradley had clearly watched the same Worthington film I had, because he designed our set piece drills around exploiting the specific weaknesses I'd identified.

"Morgan," Coach called during free kick practice. "I want you working on placement around the right edge of the wall. Worthington's wall formation leaves that space vulnerable if you can get the curve right."

"Yes, Coach."

He set up a wall of practice dummies matching Worthington's typical formation, then positioned several forwards to make runs based on where the ball would end up. It was exactly the scenario I'd been visualizing since last night.

The drill was harder than it looked. The gap at the right edge of the wall required precise curve and enough pace that the ball would reach the far post before defenders could recover. Too much curve and it sailed wide. Too little and it hit the wall.

I took my position, surveyed the setup, and struck the ball with the inside of my foot, creating the spin I needed. The ball curved around the right edge of the wall, traveling at good pace, and dropped into the exact area where Connor was making his run. In a game, that would be a real scoring threat.

"Again," Coach said. "Same setup."

I placed three more successful attempts in a row, each one curving around the wall's vulnerable edge, each one creating a legitimate scoring opportunity.

From behind me, I heard Garrett's voice: "That actually works."

I turned to find him watching, arms crossed, expression grudging but not actively hostile.

"The curve is good," he continued, clearly forcing the words out. "If you can replicate that in the game, it's a viable play."

It was the first acknowledgment I'd gotten from him all week. Not praise, not even real acceptance, but acknowledgment that my technical execution was sound.

"Thanks," I said, keeping my voice neutral.

Garrett gave a short nod, then immediately pivoted to Coach Bradley. "Should we run through the play with active defenders instead of dummies? See if the timing holds up?"

And just like that, the moment was over. He'd moved on, already thinking three steps ahead tactically, not dwelling on the fact that he'd just complimented me.

But I'd heard it. And so had everyone else at practice.

After we ran the drill with active defenders—and I successfully placed the ball for scoring opportunities in four out of five attempts—practice moved to other preparations. During a water break, Jordan jogged over.

"That free kick placement is elite," he said, wiping sweat from his forehead. "Thompson was good, but you're better. More consistent, better curve."

Thompson again—the previous set piece specialist who'd graduated. Jordan had mentioned him before, and each time it felt like validation that I wasn't just filling a spot, I was actually an upgrade.

"Thanks, Jordan. That means a lot coming from you."

"I'm serious. From a goalkeeper's perspective, balls with that kind of curve and placement are nightmares to defend. You're giving us a real weapon."

"Let's hope it translates to Saturday."

"It will. You're too prepared for it not to."

The rest of the week followed a similar rhythm. I executed drills well, received occasional acknowledgment from Garrett when my performance was too good to ignore, and continued building rapport with Connor, Jordan, and Ben.

By Friday, the team's energy had shifted into pre-game intensity. Coach ran us through final tactical preparations.

"Morgan," he said during set piece review, "you'll be our primary option on corner kicks and free kicks within thirty yards. Trust your preparation, execute your technique."

"Yes, Coach. I'm ready."

And I was. More ready than I'd been for any game in my life.

That evening, I laid out my uniform—the navy and white jersey with "MORGAN" across the back, number 10.

Kate watched me. "You're going to be great tomorrow."

"I hope so."

"I know so. You've done everything right."

I sat on my bed, holding my jersey. "What if it's not enough?"

"Then you hold your head high knowing you did your best." Kate sat beside me. "But you're not going to fail. You're too good, too prepared. You're going to show everyone exactly why you earned this position."

I wanted to believe her.

That night, I barely slept. Every time I closed my eyes, I visualized the game. Corner kicks curving into the box. Free kicks bending around the wall. The ball traveling exactly where I aimed it.

Tomorrow would be the real test. Actual competition where everything counted.

Tomorrow I'd prove I belonged.
