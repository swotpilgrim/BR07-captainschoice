# Chapter 1: Star Player

The ball came to me fifteen yards outside the box, and I didn't think—just reacted. One touch to settle, a second to create space from the defender closing in, and then I struck it. The satisfying thwack of leather meeting my laces echoed across the field as the ball curved into the upper corner, just beyond the keeper's outstretched fingers.

Goal.

My teammates mobbed me, all shouting at once, hands slapping my back and shoulders. I grinned despite myself, letting the familiar rush of scoring wash over me. Two goals in our season opener. Not a bad way to start senior year at Oakmont Academy.

"Riley, that was insane!" My teammate Ashley wrapped me in a quick hug before we jogged back to midfield. "Pure class."

I nodded my thanks, already refocusing on the game. We were up 3-1 with ten minutes left, but I'd learned from my father never to get comfortable with a lead. Coach until the final whistle, he used to say during those endless practice sessions in our backyard. Every moment matters.

The referee blew for kickoff, and I settled into my rhythm, reading the field the way Dad taught me—not just tracking the ball but seeing the spaces, anticipating where plays would develop two or three passes ahead. It was like chess on grass, and I'd been playing since I was six years old.

When the final whistle blew, we'd won 3-1. I'd scored both goals in the second half, and our record started at 1-0. As we lined up to shake hands with the other team, I scanned the bleachers out of habit. Maybe thirty people scattered across the aluminum seats—mostly parents, a few younger siblings dragged along, a handful of students who probably had friends on the team.

No scouts. There were never scouts at our games.

"Great game, Morgan," Coach Patterson said as we gathered for the post-game huddle. She was a good coach, enthusiastic and knowledgeable, but she taught history full-time and coached because she loved soccer, not because she had a staff of assistants and video analysts. "You really showed excellent vision on that second goal."

I accepted the compliment with a nod, but my attention was already drifting. Past the girls' field with its worn grass and older equipment, I could see the boys' varsity practice field in the distance. Even from here, I could tell the difference. Their field was pristine, the grass maintained like a golf course, with real bleachers—the permanent kind with backs—and a scoreboard that actually worked.

As our team broke up, some heading to the locker room and others lingering to talk with parents, I grabbed my water bottle and started the walk back toward the athletics complex. The path took me past the boys' field, and I slowed despite myself.

They were running practice—must have started right after school while we were playing our game. I recognized the setup immediately: a possession drill, probably working on quick combinations in tight spaces. What caught my eye wasn't the drill itself, though. It was everything else.

Three coaches prowled the sidelines, one with a clipboard taking notes, another filming the session with a professional-grade camera mounted on a tripod. The equipment scattered around the field was top-tier stuff—new practice pennies in bright colors, a dozen pristine balls, cone markers that actually stood up straight instead of leaning drunkenly like ours.

And in the bleachers, two men in Oakmont athletic gear sat with notebooks. I recognized the setup from my travel team days. Scouts, or maybe college coaches. Watching a Tuesday afternoon practice.

I felt something tighten in my chest—not quite jealousy, more like frustration mixed with longing. This was what a serious soccer program looked like. This was where the resources went, where the attention focused, where college recruiters showed up to watch seventeen-year-old kids practice.

"Some difference, right?"

I turned to find Kate Sullivan, my roommate and one of our defenders, falling into step beside me. Her dark hair was still pulled back in a practice ponytail, and she had that flushed, happy look she always got after games.

"Yeah," I said. "Some difference."

We walked in silence for a moment, both watching the boys' practice. Even their uniforms looked newer, the navy and white of Oakmont somehow crisper on their practice gear.

"You had a great game," Kate offered. "Those goals were beautiful."

"Thanks." I meant it, but my mind was elsewhere. "Did you see any scouts? In the stands?"

Kate shook her head. "Just the usual crowd. Why would there be scouts at a girls' game?" She said it matter-of-factly, without bitterness, just stating reality.

That was the problem, wasn't it? The reality.

We changed in the girls' locker room—adequate but aging, with tiles that needed replacing and showers that ran either too hot or barely warm—and headed back to our dorm. Oakmont Academy sprawled across two hundred acres of Pennsylvania countryside, all brick buildings and tree-lined paths. In the early September evening, campus was beautiful, the kind of place that looked like it belonged on brochures. Old money and tradition, legacy students and academic excellence.

I was here on a partial athletic scholarship. My dad coached youth soccer, my mom was a nurse. They'd stretched to make up the difference in tuition because Oakmont offered opportunities they wanted me to have. Education, connections, a path to college.

But walking past that boys' field made me wonder if I was on the right path.

Kate and I climbed the stairs to our third-floor room in Henderson Hall. Our room was small but comfortable—two beds, two desks, a shared closet, and a window that overlooked the quad. Kate immediately flopped onto her bed, still wearing her practice clothes.

"I'm exhausted," she announced. "And starving. Dining hall in twenty?"

"Sure." I moved to the window, looking out across campus. From this angle, I could just see the edge of the boys' practice field, still lit despite the fading daylight. They had lights. Professional-grade field lights that made evening practices possible.

We didn't.

"You okay?" Kate propped herself up on her elbows, watching me with that perceptive look she got sometimes. We'd been roommates since junior year, and she could read my moods pretty well by now.

"Just thinking." I turned from the window, leaning against the sill. "Do you ever wonder if we're playing the same sport?"

"What do you mean?"

"The boys' team. The resources they get, the attention, the scouts actually showing up to watch them." I gestured vaguely toward the window. "We won today. I scored two goals. And maybe thirty people cared."

Kate sat up fully now, her expression sympathetic. "It sucks. I'm not going to argue that it doesn't suck. But what can we do about it? We play college soccer next year, things will be better."

"Will they?" I crossed my arms, feeling the familiar frustration building. "Most women's college programs are underfunded too. And I need a full scholarship, Kate. My family can't afford to make up the difference like they're doing now."

"You'll get one. You're that good, Riley."

I appreciated her confidence, but confidence didn't equal opportunity. "How many scouts have you seen at our games this season? Or last season?"

Kate was quiet, because we both knew the answer. Zero. Maybe one or two would show up later in the season when we played traditional rivals, but nothing like the regular presence at boys' games.

"I don't know what to tell you," Kate said finally. "The system's not fair. But you can't change it."

I looked back out the window at those lights blazing in the distance. "Maybe not. But there must be something."

Kate didn't answer, and after a moment I grabbed my shower stuff and headed down the hall to clean up before dinner. Under the spray of lukewarm water—the third-floor showers were always temperamental—I thought about my dad's voice from countless practices.

"You control what you can control," he used to say. "You can't control refs, weather, or other players. You control your effort, your attitude, your preparation."

But what could I control about a system that gave boys' programs three coaches and professional equipment while girls' programs made do with aging hand-me-downs?

That night, after dinner and homework, I lay in bed listening to Kate's steady breathing from across the room. She'd fallen asleep easily, the way she always did. I stared at the ceiling, watching the play of shadows from the window.

Through the glass, if I sat up slightly, I could still see the glow from the boys' field lights. They were running a late practice, probably preparing for their opener later this week. I wondered what it felt like to practice under those lights, to know that scouts were watching, to have access to the best coaching and equipment and opportunities.

I wondered if I was good enough to play at that level.

The thought surprised me. I'd never doubted my ability before—confidence came naturally when you'd been training since childhood and could back it up with performance. But sitting in the dark, watching those distant lights, I felt something shift inside me. Not doubt, exactly. More like hunger.

What if there was a way? Some path I hadn't considered?

I settled back against my pillow, but sleep felt far away. My mind kept cycling through the same questions. What would it take to get that level of attention? To access those resources? To be seen as a serious athlete instead of a girl playing soccer?

Somewhere in the quad below, someone laughed, the sound carrying through the September night. Normal boarding school life, the comfortable rhythm of classes and sports and social life that made up Oakmont Academy.

But I couldn't shake the feeling that comfortable wasn't enough anymore. I wanted more. I wanted better. I wanted what those boys on that lit field took for granted.

I just didn't know how to get it.

Not yet.
