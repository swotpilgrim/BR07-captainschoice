# Chapter 2: The Announcement

Monday morning assembly was usually something you endured rather than enjoyed. The entire student body crammed into Oakmont's traditional auditorium while the headmaster droned through announcements about club meetings and dress code.

I sat with Kate halfway back, only half listening as Headmaster Reynolds welcomed everyone to another week. My mind was still on yesterday's practice, working on free kicks from different angles.

"And now," Headmaster Reynolds said, his voice taking on a different quality that made me glance up, "I'm pleased to announce an exciting innovation in our athletic programs."

The auditorium settled into attentive quiet.

"Oakmont Academy has always prided itself on providing exceptional opportunities for all our student-athletes." Reynolds stood behind the podium, looking genuinely enthused about whatever he was building toward. "This year, we're taking an important step in ensuring those opportunities are truly available to everyone."

I felt Kate shift beside me, paying attention now.

"Beginning immediately, our boys' varsity soccer program will open one roster position to female student-athletes." Reynolds paused, letting the murmur of surprise ripple through the auditorium. "Specifically, a specialized kicking position for set pieces—corner kicks, free kicks, and penalty situations."

My heart kicked hard against my ribs. A position on the boys' team. Access to those coaches, that equipment, those scouts in the stands.

"This position will be filled through open tryouts, available to any current female student-athlete in good academic standing. Selection will be based entirely on demonstrated skill, as evaluated by Coach Bradley and his staff. Tryouts will be held this Thursday after classes on the varsity field."

The auditorium exploded into conversation, voices overlapping in excitement and skepticism and curiosity. I barely heard any of it. My mind was already racing—Thursday, three days away. I needed to practice, prepare, make sure my accuracy was perfect.

"This is a pilot program," Reynolds continued, raising his voice to be heard over the chatter. "We believe it represents an important opportunity for female athletes to access the same level of coaching, resources, and recruitment visibility available to their male counterparts. The position will require the same commitment, discipline, and skill we expect from all our varsity athletes."

Kate grabbed my arm, leaning close to whisper. "Riley. You have to try out."

"Yeah," I managed, my voice sounding distant to my own ears. "Yeah, I'm going to."

Reynolds provided more details—tryout format, eligibility requirements, the fact that whoever earned the position would be held to identical standards as the rest of the team. No special treatment, no adjusted expectations. The real thing.

When assembly dismissed, the auditorium erupted into noise. Everyone was talking about the announcement. I kept my expression neutral, but inside I felt like electricity was running through my veins. This was it. The opportunity I'd been lying awake wondering about.

We'd barely made it into the hallway when I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned to find Alex Bennett, captain of the girls' team, her expression serious.

"Can we talk?" she asked. "Just for a minute?"

Kate glanced at me, then made herself scarce with a murmured excuse about needing to grab a book from her locker before first period. Alex steered me toward a quieter corner of the hallway, away from the flow of students heading to class.

"So," Alex said, crossing her arms. She was tall, lean, with the kind of natural athleticism that made her a standout forward. College scouts had been calling her since sophomore year. "I'm guessing you're thinking about trying out."

No point in denying it. "Yeah. I am."

Alex nodded, like she'd expected this answer. "I figured. You'd be stupid not to, honestly. Your technical skills are probably the best on our team."

"Thanks." I waited, sensing there was more coming.

"But I need to ask—" Alex paused, choosing her words carefully. "If you make it, that's it for the girls' team, right? You can't play for both. We lose our leading scorer mid-season."

The complexity of her tone made sense now. This wasn't jealousy or resentment. It was a captain thinking about her team.

"I know," I said quietly. "I've thought about that."

"Have you?" Alex's eyes were steady on mine. "Because we've got a decent shot at regional championships this year. You're a huge part of that. And the girls' program—Riley, if our best players leave for the boys' team, what does that say? What message does it send about whether we're worth investing in?"

I felt the weight of her words, the genuine concern behind them. Alex wasn't trying to guilt me out of pursuing this. She was raising legitimate questions about what my choice meant.

"I hear you," I said. "And I don't have perfect answers. But Alex, when's the last time a college scout came to one of our games?"

She didn't respond immediately, because we both knew the answer.

"I need a full scholarship," I continued. "My family can't afford to pay my way through college. The girls' program is good, but it doesn't get the visibility I need. This position—if I can win it—gives me access to resources and recruitment attention that could change everything for me."

Alex studied me for a long moment, then sighed. "I get it. I do. I've already got offers, so it's easy for me to talk about staying and building the girls' program. You're in a different situation."

"I'm not trying to abandon the team," I said, needing her to understand. "This isn't about thinking the boys are better or the girls' program doesn't matter. It's about doing what I need to do for my future."

"I know." Alex's expression softened slightly. "And honestly? Part of me is proud of you for going for it. Just promise me you'll kill it if you make the team. Make them respect you. Make them see what female athletes can do."

"I promise."

We stood there for another moment in the thinning hallway crowd, the bell about to ring for first period.

"Good luck Thursday," Alex said finally. "Seriously. Show them what Oakmont girls are made of."

She squeezed my shoulder once, then headed off toward her first class. I watched her go, feeling the complicated mix of emotions her words had stirred up. Pride at her support, guilt about leaving the girls' team, determination to prove this was the right choice.

The bell rang, and I hurried toward calculus, sliding into my seat just as Mr. Peterson started writing equations on the board. Kate shot me a questioning look from across the room, and I gave her a small nod that said we'd talk later.

I pulled out my notebook, copied down the problem Mr. Peterson was explaining. But none of it stuck. My mind kept drifting to Thursday's tryouts, to myself wearing that navy and white practice jersey.

Accuracy. Consistency under pressure. Corner kick placement. Free kicks with the right curve and power. Penalty shot composure.

My dad had drilled all of it into me since childhood.

"Miss Morgan?"

I jerked my attention back to the classroom to find Mr. Peterson looking at me expectantly, marker in hand.

"Could you solve the equation on the board?"

I looked at the board, at the calculus problem I hadn't been following, and felt heat creep up my neck. "I—sorry, could you repeat the question?"

A few students snickered. Mr. Peterson's expression said he knew exactly where my attention had been, and it wasn't on derivatives.

"See me after class, please."

I nodded, mortified, and tried to focus for the remaining forty minutes. It was nearly impossible. Every time I forced my attention back to calculus, my mind would drift to kicking technique, to the boys' practice field, to the opportunity that felt too big to fully process.

When class finally ended, I approached Mr. Peterson's desk while other students filed out. Kate lingered near the door, waiting for me.

"I apologize," I said before he could speak. "I was distracted. It won't happen again."

Mr. Peterson leaned back in his chair, studying me with the same analytical gaze he used on mathematical proofs. "I heard about the athletic announcement. I'm guessing that's where your mind was?"

"Yes, sir."

"Are you planning to try out?"

I hesitated, then nodded.

"Then I'll give you the same advice I'd give any student pursuing a significant opportunity." He tapped his pen on the stack of papers on his desk. "Focus is a skill, Miss Morgan. The ability to be fully present in each moment, whether you're taking a kick or solving an equation. If you're going to compete at that level, you'll need to master it."

"Yes, sir. You're right."

"I expect you to be present in my class, regardless of what else is happening in your life. Understood?"

"Understood."

He nodded, dismissing me. I grabbed my bag and joined Kate in the hallway, and we headed toward our next class.

"What did he say?" Kate asked.

"That I need to focus." I shifted my backpack, feeling the truth of it. "He's not wrong."

The rest of the day passed in a blur. By the time I got back to our dorm that afternoon, I felt exhausted from trying to focus on normal school things when my brain wanted nothing but to prepare for Thursday.

I changed into running clothes and headed to the campus trails. Running helped me think.

The trails were quiet—just me and the rhythm of my footfalls on packed dirt. I fell into an easy pace, working through everything.

Three days until tryouts. I needed to be undeniably good, so good there'd be no question I'd earned the position on merit. That's what everyone would be watching for—whether I was actually skilled enough or whether this was just symbolic.

I thought about Alex's words, about what it meant to leave the girls' team. But staying with a program that didn't get the resources I needed wouldn't help me get to college. Wouldn't help my family afford my education.

My dad's voice: You control what you can control.

I could control how hard I worked. How I performed on Thursday.

Everything else—the politics, the symbolism—that was bigger than me. I could only make my kicks and hope it was enough.

By the time I looped back to campus, the boys' practice field was active. I slowed, watching from a distance.

In three days, if everything went right, I'd be out there with them.

I headed back to my dorm, showered, and tried to focus on homework. Kate eventually gave up trying to talk to me about anything other than the tryouts and quizzed me on kick techniques while I pretended to read history.

That night, lying in bed, I visualized myself on that field. Each type of kick, the ball curving exactly where I aimed it, the solid contact of leather on leather.

Thursday couldn't come fast enough.
