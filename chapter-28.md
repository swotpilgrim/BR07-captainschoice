# Chapter 28: Public and Private

The weekend after championship felt surreal. Everywhere I went on campus, people congratulated me. The student newspaper ran a front-page story with photos from the game. Someone had created a highlight reel of my season's set pieces that played on loop in the student center.

I'd gone from outsider fighting for acceptance to campus celebrity in one championship-winning assist.

It was overwhelming and validating and slightly uncomfortable all at once.

Saturday afternoon, the team gathered for a casual celebration at one of the senior's off-campus apartment. No coaches, no parents, just players relaxing after achieving what we'd worked toward all season.

I arrived with Kate, who'd been invited as my guest and moral support. The apartment was already crowded with teammates and their friends, music playing, everyone in good spirits.

Garrett was in the kitchen when I walked in. Our eyes met across the room, and the smile he gave me was warm and private despite the public setting. I smiled back, feeling Kate elbow me knowingly.

"You two are terrible at hiding it," she whispered.

"We're not trying to hide it anymore," I whispered back. "Just waiting for the right moment to actually tell people."

Connor appeared with drinks, handing me and Kate sodas. "Morgan! The hero of the hour!"

"Team effort," I said automatically.

"Team effort that you clinched with a perfect assist." He raised his cup. "Seriously, that kick was beautiful. Exactly the kind of clutch performance we needed."

We settled into conversation about the game, other teammates joining to recount favorite moments and close calls. The atmosphere was relaxed, celebratory, the easy camaraderie of people who'd achieved something difficult together.

Garrett moved through the party like the natural leader he was, making sure everyone felt included, facilitating conversations, being the captain even in casual settings. But I noticed how his attention kept drifting back to me, how he positioned himself to be in my vicinity without making it obvious.

How when we ended up in the same conversation circle, we gravitated toward standing next to each other.

"Okay, you two need to just tell people already," Connor said, appearing beside us with his girlfriend. "The tension is painful to watch."

I looked at Garrett. He looked at me.

"Tomorrow," Garrett said. "We're going to tell people tomorrow."

Connor grinned. "Finally. For the record, most of the team already knows. Or at least suspects strongly."

"How?" I asked.

"Riley, you look at each other like you're the only people in the room. It's sweet and slightly nauseating." His girlfriend laughed and nodded agreement.

After Connor left, Garrett leaned closer. "Does it bother you that people have guessed?"

"No," I realized. "I'm actually kind of relieved. Makes tomorrow easier."

"Tomorrow," Garrett agreed. "After we tell people officially, we can actually be together in public. No more hiding."

The promise in his voice made warmth spread through my chest.

Sunday afternoon, Garrett texted: *Want to walk the trails? Time to actually talk without hiding.*

I met him at the trailhead, both of us in casual clothes, the November air crisp enough to see our breath. The campus trails were mostly empty on a Sunday afternoon—most students studying or recovering from weekend celebrations.

Which meant privacy. Real privacy, for one of the first times since we'd acknowledged our feelings.

"Ready for tomorrow?" I asked as we started walking.

"Ready to stop pretending we're just teammates? Absolutely." Garrett's hand found mine naturally, our fingers lacing together. "How about you?"

"Same. Though I'm curious what reaction we'll get."

"Probably a mix of 'finally' and 'I knew it' based on Connor's comments yesterday." He smiled. "I don't think we're as subtle as we thought."

We walked in comfortable silence for a while, leaves crunching underfoot, weak sunshine filtering through bare branches. The physical distance we'd maintained all season was gone now, replaced by easy proximity—shoulders touching, hands linked, the natural intimacy of a couple.

"Can I ask you something?" Garrett said eventually.

"Anything."

"Do you regret it? Joining the boys' team, dealing with all the resistance and pressure, everything you went through?"

I considered the question seriously. "Three months ago, if you'd asked me that during one of your cold shoulder phases, I might have had doubts. The resistance was harder than I expected, and there were definitely moments I questioned whether it was worth it."

"And now?"

"Now I know it was absolutely worth it. Not just for the championship or the Penn State scholarship offer—though those are amazing. But for everything I learned about myself, about real partnership, about earning respect through performance." I squeezed his hand. "And for meeting you. For us."

Garrett stopped walking, turning to face me. "You know what I've realized?"

"What?"

"You taught me more about leadership than anyone else ever has. Before you joined the team, I thought being captain meant having all the answers, maintaining control, never showing weakness. I was rigid and closed-off and honestly kind of insufferable."

I started to protest, but he shook his head.

"I was. Ask Connor—he'll tell you stories. But watching you handle pressure with grace, watching you prove yourself through skill and character, watching you adapt without losing yourself... you showed me what real strength looks like."

"Garrett—"

"I'm a better captain because of you. A better player, a better teammate, a better person. Whatever happens next—college, soccer careers, all of it—I'll be better because I knew you."

The sincerity in his voice made my throat tight.

"You changed me too," I said. "Taught me that earning respect is worth more than demanding it. That partnership is stronger than competition. That letting someone in doesn't make you weaker." I stepped closer. "I came to Oakmont for soccer. I found you instead. Or in addition to. Both things matter."

"Both things matter," Garrett agreed. He cupped my face in his hands, thumbs brushing my cheekbones. "I love you, Riley Morgan."

The words hung between us, significant and slightly terrifying.

"I love you too," I said, and felt the truth of it settle into place.

We kissed there on the trail, unhurried and sweet, the declaration still echoing between us. When we finally pulled apart, we were both smiling.

"So," Garrett said, "Penn State offered you a full scholarship."

"Yeah. Division I women's program, starting position available."

"That's incredible. You've earned it." He hesitated. "Have you decided if you'll accept?"

"Probably. It's everything I've wanted—top program, full ride, chance to compete at the highest level." I studied his expression. "What about you? Where are you looking for college?"

"Got offers from a few Division II schools. Penn State actually reached out too—they're interested in me for their men's team."

My heart skipped. "Penn State? You're considering Penn State?"

"Considering seriously. It's a strong program, good scholarship offer, and..." he smiled, "the women's and men's soccer programs train in adjacent facilities. So we'd be on the same campus, even if not the same team."

The possibility of continuing together beyond Oakmont, of pursuing our soccer dreams while staying connected, felt almost too good to be true.

"We shouldn't make college decisions based on relationships," I said carefully.

"No," Garrett agreed. "We should make them based on what's best for our futures. But if those futures can happen to align at a school that's genuinely great for both of us? That's not compromise. That's just lucky timing."

"Very lucky timing."

We walked further, discussing college plans and scholarship details, balancing dreams with practicality. The conversation felt mature, honest, neither of us willing to sacrifice our ambitions but both hoping to find ways to maintain what we'd built.

"Whatever happens," Garrett said as we looped back toward campus, "even if we end up at different schools, I want to try to make this work. Long distance if we have to. Because what we have is worth it."

"Yeah," I agreed. "It really is."

That evening, Garrett texted the team group chat: *Team meeting tomorrow, 4pm, film room. Mandatory attendance.*

Connor replied immediately: *This about you and Morgan finally admitting you're dating?*

Garrett's response: *Among other things. Just be there.*

I stared at my phone, heart racing. Tomorrow, our relationship would be official. Public. Real in a way it hadn't been while we kept it secret.

"Nervous?" Kate asked from her desk.

"Terrified. Excited. Both."

"The team will be supportive. They already know, or at least suspect. And after the championship, anyone who objects can shove it."

She was right. I'd proven myself beyond doubt. My relationship with Garrett wouldn't change what I'd accomplished or earned.

But still, making it official felt significant.

I texted Garrett: *Ready for tomorrow?*

His response came immediately: *Been ready since the moment I realized I was falling for you. Can't wait to stop hiding.*

Neither could I.

That night, I lay in bed thinking about everything that had changed since trying out for the boys' team. I'd come to Oakmont wanting better resources and recruitment opportunities. I'd found those things—the championship medal hanging on my wall and Penn State scholarship offer proved that.

But I'd also found partnership, respect, and love with someone who challenged me to be better while accepting exactly who I was.

Tomorrow, everyone would know.

And I was ready.

More than ready.

I was proud.

Proud of what we'd built together, proud of what we'd overcome, proud of the relationship that had developed through mutual respect and genuine partnership.

Tomorrow, Garrett and I would stand together in front of our team and tell them what everyone already suspected.

And then we could finally be ourselves. Publicly. Completely.

I fell asleep smiling, dreaming of trail walks where we could hold hands without looking over our shoulders, of studying together in the library without maintaining careful distance, of all the small freedoms that came with being able to be honest about loving someone.

Tomorrow couldn't come fast enough.
