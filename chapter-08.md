# Chapter 8: First Game

Saturday arrived with perfect soccer weather—cool and clear, low sixties. I woke up before my alarm, nervous energy humming through my body.

I went through my pre-game routine on autopilot: shower, protein bar and banana, double-check my gear. My hands were steady, but my stomach felt like it was doing flip-flops.

First varsity game.

The game was at home, three o'clock kickoff. I arrived at the athletics complex at one-thirty to find the locker area already buzzing with pre-game energy. Players were getting taped, changing into uniforms, going through their individual preparation rituals.

I changed in my converted office, pulling on the game jersey—heavier fabric than practice gear, the number 10 seeming to carry more weight than usual. Navy shorts, long socks, cleats laced tight. I braided my hair back severely, not a strand out of place.

When I emerged, some teammates were already heading to the field for warmups. Connor caught my eye and nodded. "Game day, Morgan. You ready?"

"Ready."

The field looked different on game day—the stands filling with students, parents, and alumni, the atmosphere charged with anticipation. I spotted Kate in the stands with the girls' soccer team, Alex giving me a thumbs up. My stomach flipped again.

Coach Bradley gathered us for pre-game instructions. "Worthington is physical and disciplined. We match their intensity, we execute our game plan, we exploit the weaknesses we've identified. Morgan—" he looked at me directly, "—you'll be on the bench to start as our specialized player. When we get set piece opportunities in scoring positions, I'll signal you in. Be ready."

"Yes, Coach."

The game started without me. I sat on the bench watching our starters take the field. Garrett wore the captain's armband, directing traffic in midfield.

Worthington came out aggressive, pressing high and challenging every ball. The game was physical—hard tackles, bodies flying into challenges.

We traded chances for twenty minutes. Then Worthington scored off a quick counter. 1-0.

Ten minutes later, Connor equalized with a beautiful header. 1-1. The bench erupted, and I found myself cheering with my teammates.

The game stayed tight through halftime. Coach Bradley's talk emphasized patience. "The opportunities will come. When they do, we finish."

The second half was more of the same—back and forth, both teams fighting for any advantage. My legs itched to be on the field.

Then, sixty-three minutes in, we earned a corner kick deep in Worthington's attacking zone. Coach Bradley looked down the bench directly at me.

"Morgan! You're in!"

My heart kicked into overdrive. I jumped up, ran to check in with the fourth official, and sprinted onto the field when the referee waved me in.

The crowd noise changed—got louder, more energized. I heard some cheers, some awkward silence, the weight of everyone watching to see what the girl kicker would do.

I blocked it out. Focused on the task.

At the corner arc, I picked up the ball and surveyed the situation while our players jogged into the box and Worthington's defenders organized their marking. This was exactly what I'd studied in the film—their zonal marking setup, the tendencies I'd identified.

Garrett was directing our positioning from the top of the box, his voice cutting through the noise. "Connor near post! Ben far post! Morgan—place it near post, driven hard with pace."

I looked at the actual defensive setup. Worthington had three defenders packed into the near post area, exactly like I'd seen in the film. But far post—where Ben was positioned against a shorter defender—was vulnerable. There was space, there was opportunity.

I jogged toward Garrett. "The far post is open. Ben's got the height advantage—"

"Near post," Garrett cut me off, his voice sharp with authority. "That's my call as captain. Place it near post with pace."

"But Garrett, look at their spacing—"

"Morgan." His eyes were hard. "Execute the play I called. Near post. Now."

I stood there for a heartbeat, my tactical instincts screaming that he was wrong. Far post was the right call. I could see it as clearly as I could see the ball in my hands.

But he was the captain. This was my first game. And everyone was watching.

I jogged back to the corner arc, placed the ball, and stepped back to measure my approach. Near post. Driven hard with pace. That's what Garrett called.

I pushed away my doubt and focused on execution. If I was going to place it near post, I'd make it the best near post kick I could deliver.

I ran forward and struck the ball cleanly, driving it toward the near post area with the pace and height Garrett wanted. The ball curved in, spinning, exactly where I'd aimed it based on his instructions.

But exactly what I'd feared happened. Three defenders converged on the near post, bodies jumping and colliding. The ball hit the first defender's shoulder and deflected away, cleared easily by Worthington's defense. Opportunity lost.

I stood at the corner, frustration burning in my chest as I jogged back toward the bench. I'd executed the kick perfectly. It just hadn't been the right tactical call.

The game ground on, physical and intense. Neither team could find a breakthrough. When the final whistle blew, the score stayed 1-1. A tie.

In the handshake line, Worthington's players were professional and respectful. A few looked at me curiously—the girl on the boys' team—but no one said anything inappropriate.

Coach Bradley gathered us after. "Tough game, hard-fought. We created chances but couldn't finish. Worthington's a good team, and we earned a point on the day. We'll review film Monday and learn from this."

He didn't mention the corner kick specifically, but I felt its weight anyway. A chance wasted, a missed opportunity.

The team dispersed toward the locker rooms. I was heading to my changing area when Connor fell into step beside me.

"Hey," he said quietly. "Good kick."

"It didn't work."

"Because it was the wrong call." Connor glanced around to make sure no one was listening. "Your instinct was right. Far post was wide open—I saw it from the box. Ben had his guy beat by four inches in height. That ball to far post would've been a goal."

The validation stung almost as much as the wasted opportunity. "Garrett called near post."

"I know. And he was wrong." Connor's voice was gentle but firm. "You saw the field correctly. Your tactical read was better than his."

"Doesn't matter if I can't execute it."

"It matters. You need to trust your instincts, Riley. You're out there because you're good at this. Don't second-guess yourself just because someone with a captain's armband disagrees."

He headed off to the locker room, leaving me standing there processing his words.

Back in my changing area, I peeled off my game jersey slowly. First varsity game complete. I'd gotten onto the field, executed my technical skills.

But I hadn't helped us win. And I couldn't shake the feeling that if I'd trusted my tactical judgment over Garrett's authority, the outcome might have been different.

Kate found me leaving the complex.

"You played!" she said, hugging me. "How does it feel?"

"Complicated."

"What happened?"

I sighed. "I called the right target, but the captain overruled me. So I executed his call, which was wrong."

"Garrett?"

"Yeah. I saw the opening at far post, suggested it, and he shut me down. Made me place it where Worthington had their strength concentrated."

"On purpose?"

"No. He genuinely believed near post was right. He just wouldn't consider that I might be right."

Kate linked her arm through mine as we walked across campus. "For what it's worth, a bunch of us thought it looked like a solid kick. The execution was good."

"Execution doesn't matter if the tactical decision is wrong."

We walked in silence for a bit. The campus was beautiful in the late afternoon light, other students enjoying the weekend, normal college life happening all around us while I replayed one failed corner kick over and over in my head.

"You know what my dad would say?" I asked eventually.

"What?"

"That I can't control other people's decisions. I can only control my own preparation and execution. That I did my part by seeing the field correctly and placing the ball where I was told to place it."

"Your dad sounds wise."

"He is. But it still sucks."

Back in our dorm room, I showered and changed. My phone buzzed with a text from my dad: "How'd it go?"

I typed: "Played in second half. Executed well but didn't score. Lots to learn."

His response: "First game is always learning. Proud of you. Growth happens one game at a time."

I wanted to believe him. Wanted to believe there'd be more opportunities, that eventually my tactical judgment would be trusted.

But sitting there, replaying that moment when I'd seen the right call and been overruled, I couldn't shake the frustration.

I'd earned my place through skill. But skill wasn't enough if every decision had to run through a captain who wouldn't consider that I might see something he didn't.

Tomorrow we'd review film. Monday, back to practice.

I'd have to find a way to make my voice heard without undermining team hierarchy. Had to prove my tactical judgment was worth listening to.

Had to figure out how to be both a good teammate and someone who trusted her own instincts.

It felt like an impossible balance.

But I'd figure it out. I had to.
