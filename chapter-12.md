# Chapter 12: Team Bonding

The bus for the away game left Friday afternoon at two. Three-hour drive to Northfield Academy, overnight stay, game Saturday morning. My first away trip with the team.

I boarded with my bag and gear, unsure where to sit. The unspoken bus hierarchy—seniors toward the back, underclassmen up front.

"Morgan! Back here!" Connor waved from the rear where he'd claimed a four-seat section with Jordan and Ben.

I made my way down and slid into the seat across from them.

"You play cards?" Connor asked, pulling out a deck.

"Depends on the game."

"Hearts. We play for bragging rights and whoever loses buys the winners Gatorade at the next gas station."

"I'm in."

The first hour of the drive passed quickly, the four of us locked in increasingly competitive rounds of Hearts. Connor talked trash constantly, Jordan played with quiet intensity, and Ben had a habit of sighing dramatically whenever he got stuck with the Queen of Spades.

"This is rigged," Ben declared after the third round. "Jordan's counting cards or something."

"I'm just paying attention," Jordan said mildly, laying down another perfect card.

Other teammates drifted over to watch or offer commentary. Tyler leaned over the seat to critique Ben's terrible strategy. Marcus placed bets on who'd win each round. The back of the bus became this contained bubble of competition and camaraderie.

At some point, I realized I was laughing—really laughing—at Connor's increasingly absurd excuses for why he was losing and Ben's theatrical outrage at his bad luck.

This was team bonding. Not forced, not structured, just teammates killing time on a bus ride and actually enjoying each other's company.

Garrett sat a few rows ahead with Derek and some other seniors, occasionally glancing back at the noise we were making but not commenting. The physical distance felt intentional, like he was maintaining some invisible line between captain and team, or maybe between himself and me specifically.

By the time we reached the hotel, I'd lost count of how many rounds we'd played. Jordan won overall, which surprised no one, and Connor immediately demanded a rematch on the ride home.

The hotel was a standard mid-range place near Northfield's campus. Coach Bradley gathered us in the lobby for room assignments and logistics.

"Dinner at six in the hotel restaurant. Team meeting at eight to review game plan. Lights out by ten—I want everyone rested for tomorrow. Morgan, you're in room 412, single accommodation."

I grabbed my key card, hyperaware that I was the only one getting a single room while everyone else doubled up. It was necessary for obvious reasons, but it marked me as different once again.

The room was fine—generic hotel setup with one bed, desk, bathroom. I dropped my bags and checked the time. An hour before team dinner.

I showered and changed into clean clothes, then headed down to the restaurant at six. The team had taken over a large section, tables pushed together to accommodate everyone.

"Morgan!" Jordan gestured to an empty seat between him and Connor. "Saved you a spot."

I slid into the chair, accepting a menu from the server. The table buzzed with pre-game energy—guys talking about the upcoming match, making predictions, going over tactical keys.

"Their striker is fast," Ben was saying. "Like, really fast. If we give him space to run, he'll burn us."

"That's why we press high," Connor said. "Make them play under pressure before they can get the ball to him in space."

I listened, adding occasional input when the conversation touched on set pieces or defensive positioning. It felt natural now, contributing without second-guessing whether my voice mattered.

Halfway through dinner, Derek's voice cut across the conversation. "Must be nice, Morgan. Getting your own room while the rest of us have to share."

The table went quiet. I felt heat creep up my neck but kept my expression neutral.

"Accommodations are Coach's decision," I said evenly. "Not mine."

"Right, but you're still getting special treatment. Private changing area, single hotel room, probably other perks we don't even know about—"

"Derek." Garrett's voice wasn't loud, but it carried authority. "Drop it."

Derek turned to look at Garrett, clearly surprised. "I'm just saying—"

"You're making an issue where there isn't one. Accommodations are logistical, not preferential. Morgan didn't ask for special treatment, and she doesn't get any where it matters—on the field." Garrett's tone was firm. "Let it go."

Derek's jaw tightened, but he shut up and returned to his food.

The conversation gradually resumed, but I felt the weight of what had just happened. Garrett had defended me. Not effusively, not as a friend might, but as a captain protecting a teammate from unfair criticism.

Across the table, Connor caught my eye and gave me a small nod. Jordan squeezed my shoulder briefly—a silent show of solidarity.

The rest of dinner passed without incident, the team's energy shifting to excitement about tomorrow's game.

Back in my room later, I tried to sleep but couldn't settle. Too much nervous energy, too many tactical thoughts running through my mind. At eleven o'clock, I gave up, grabbed my laptop, and headed down to the hotel lobby.

The lobby was quiet, just the night desk clerk and a businesswoman working on her laptop in the corner. I claimed an armchair near the windows and pulled up the game film I'd already watched three times.

Northfield's defensive patterns, their goalkeeper's tendencies, the spacing weaknesses we could exploit. I made notes, visualized kick placements, tried to channel my restless energy into preparation.

"Can't sleep either?"

I jumped slightly and looked up to find Garrett standing there in Oakmont athletic department sweats, his own laptop under his arm.

"Too wired," I admitted.

"Same." He hesitated, then gestured to the chair across from mine. "Mind if I...?"

"Go ahead."

He sat down, opened his laptop, and for a few minutes we worked in silence. Me reviewing set piece opportunities, him looking at what appeared to be offensive positioning patterns.

The silence wasn't comfortable exactly, but it wasn't hostile either. Just two teammates who couldn't sleep before a big game, both doing what they did to prepare.

"What are you looking at?" Garrett asked eventually, his voice quiet in the empty lobby.

I turned my laptop so he could see the screen. "Northfield's goalkeeper on corners. See how he positions himself? He favors his near post, probably because he's stronger diving that direction. But it leaves the far post more vulnerable than it should be."

Garrett leaned forward, studying the footage. "You're right. I hadn't caught that."

I clicked to another clip. "And here—their wall formation on free kicks. Same four players every time, same spacing. If we can get the ball up and over the left edge with enough curve, there's a lane."

"You've been studying them closely."

"That's the job."

He nodded, still watching the screen. Then he pulled his laptop around. "Look at this. Their midfield tends to collapse toward the ball carrier, especially when under pressure. See the space it creates on the weak side?"

I studied his screen, seeing what he was pointing out. "If we can switch the ball quickly, we'd have numbers up on the opposite flank."

"Exactly." He clicked through a few more clips, showing me the pattern repeating. "Connor's good at making far-post runs. If we can get him isolated against their fullback with space..."

"He'd destroy them one-on-one."

We fell back into silence, both reviewing our respective footage. But something had shifted. The silence felt less awkward, more like the comfortable quiet of shared focus.

I noticed a defensive pattern in another clip and pointed it out. Garrett saw an offensive opportunity I'd missed and showed me. Back and forth, brief tactical exchanges, two soccer minds engaged in the same problem-solving process.

At some point, we both identified the same weakness at the exact same moment—Northfield's tendency to overcommit to marking runs near post, leaving the top of the box exposed.

"That space right there—" I started.

"If we can place someone at the top of the box—" Garrett said simultaneously.

We stopped, looked at each other, and something flickered across his expression. Surprise, maybe. Or recognition that we were seeing the field the same way.

"You could hit that space on a corner kick," he said.

"And you could position someone there to clean up any clearances."

"Ben's good at attacking second balls."

We mapped out the play, building on each other's tactical insights, and by the time we finished, we'd designed a set piece opportunity that could genuinely work.

The clock on the wall showed twelve-thirty. We'd been down here for over an hour.

"I should try to sleep," I said, closing my laptop. "Game in less than twelve hours."

"Yeah. Me too."

We stood, gathering our things. The awkwardness crept back in now that the tactical distraction was gone—two people who'd been in conflict, who maintained professional distance, suddenly aware that they'd just spent an hour working together easily.

"Morgan," Garrett said as I turned toward the elevators. I looked back. "That play we designed. The corner kick with Ben at the top of the box. Let's run it tomorrow if we get the opportunity."

"Okay."

"It's a good play. You saw something I didn't."

It wasn't an apology for our conflicts. It wasn't a declaration of friendship. But it was acknowledgment—genuine, unforced acknowledgment that my tactical mind brought value.

"Goodnight, Garrett."

"Goodnight."

I rode the elevator back to my floor, replaying the last hour. Garrett and I, working together voluntarily. Sharing insights, building on each other's ideas, finding that rare sync when two people understood the game the same way.

It had been easy. Almost comfortable. And that was both encouraging and confusing.

Back in my room, I finally felt tired enough to sleep. Tomorrow's game plan felt solid. The team felt united. And Garrett had defended me at dinner and collaborated with me in the lobby—progress, even if I couldn't define what kind.

I set my alarm and climbed into bed, feeling more settled than I had in weeks.

Whatever happened tomorrow, I wasn't facing it alone.
