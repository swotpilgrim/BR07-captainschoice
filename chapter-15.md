# Chapter 15: Partnership Forming

The shift in dynamics after Garrett's apology was immediate.

Wednesday's practice, he jogged over during set piece drills. "What do you think about this defensive formation? Their left side looks vulnerable."

"Agreed. If I can curve it around their wall's right edge, there's space."

"Let's practice that."

We worked through the play—collaborative, seamless. Garrett positioning players based on my read, me adjusting placement based on his feedback.

Coach Bradley watched from the sideline, nodding.

After practice, he called us over. "That's what effective collaboration looks like. Reading the field together, communicating clearly. The team sees that and it raises everyone's level."

"Thanks, Coach," we said in unison.

Friday's game against Riverside Academy felt different. Not because the stakes were higher, but because I felt truly integrated.

During warmups, Garrett pulled me aside. "Remember that free kick play we designed?"

"Yeah."

"If we get the opportunity, let's run it."

"You sure?"

"I trust your execution. And I trust we designed a play that works."

The collaborative "we" felt significant.

The game was tight and physical. Riverside was well-organized defensively, difficult to break down.

Then, twenty-eight minutes in, Riverside committed a foul outside the penalty box. Perfect range.

Garrett caught my eye and nodded. Our play.

Coach Bradley sent me in. As I approached the ball, Garrett jogged over, ostensibly to set up the wall but really to confirm the details.

"Connor makes the near post run to draw defenders. Ben delays at the top of the box, then runs far post when you strike. I'll position someone at the edge for cleanup if needed."

"Curve around the right edge of the wall, pace to reach the far post before their keeper can adjust."

"Exactly."

He squeezed my shoulder once—brief contact, encouragement—then jogged away to position players.

I placed the ball, stepped back, surveyed the setup. Everything we'd designed, everything we'd practiced, coming together in this moment.

The whistle blew.

I ran forward and struck the ball with the inside of my right foot, creating the curve we needed. The ball sailed up and around the right edge of the wall, spinning exactly as I'd intended.

Connor made his near post run, dragging two defenders with him. Ben delayed perfectly, then broke for the far post just as the ball dropped into the space.

Ben met it with his head, a glancing redirection that sent the ball past the diving keeper and into the net.

Goal.

The celebration erupted. Our bench cleared, players rushing onto the field. I found myself in the middle of the chaos, teammates mobbing Ben, everyone shouting at once.

Then Garrett was there, appearing through the mass of bodies, and before I could process what was happening, he'd lifted me off my feet in a quick hug.

"Perfect execution!" he shouted over the noise.

The contact lasted maybe two seconds. Brief, celebratory, the kind of thing teammates do after scoring. But as he set me back down, our eyes met for a heartbeat, and something passed between us that had nothing to do with soccer.

Then the moment broke. Garrett stepped back slightly, awareness crossing his face like he'd just realized what he'd done. I felt heat creep up my neck, my heart racing in a way that felt different from game adrenaline.

"Good play," he said, his voice slightly rougher than usual.

"Yeah. Good positioning."

We stood there in the celebration chaos, aware of each other in a new way, both clearly unsure what to do with that awareness.

Connor crashed into me from the side, breaking the moment. "Morgan! That kick was insane!"

I let myself be pulled into the celebration, but I was hyperaware of Garrett even as I hugged other teammates. Aware of where he was, how he moved through the celebration, the fact that he kept glancing in my direction like he was also hyperaware of me.

What was that?

---

We won 2-0. Solid defensive performance, clinical finishing, the kind of complete team effort that felt satisfying in every way.

On the walk back to the locker area, the team's energy was high—talking about the game, making plans for the weekend, riding the victory high.

I peeled off toward my changing area, but as I reached the door, Garrett appeared beside me.

"Hey. Good game."

"Thanks. You too. That through ball to Connor in the second half was perfect."

"Team effort." He shifted his weight, seeming uncertain about something. "You walking back to the dorms after you change?"

"Yeah, why?"

"Mind if I walk with you? I wanted to talk about the game plan for next week's opponent."

It was a reasonable request—captain and set piece specialist discussing tactics. But something in how he asked, slightly hesitant, made it feel like more than just soccer talk.

"Sure. Give me ten minutes to change."

"I'll wait out front."

I changed quickly, my mind spinning. The celebration hug, the awareness, now this. What was happening between us?

When I emerged, Garrett was leaning against the building, backpack slung over one shoulder, looking at his phone. He glanced up when I approached and pocketed the phone.

"Ready?"

We started walking across campus together, the late afternoon sun warm on our faces. For a few minutes, neither of us spoke, just walked in comfortable silence.

"So next week's opponent," Garrett started, then stopped. "Actually, can I ask you something else?"

"Sure."

"How do you like Oakmont? Beyond soccer."

The shift to personal territory surprised me. "It's good. Academically challenging. The people are... mostly good."

He smiled. "Mostly."

"Some people took longer to warm up," I said pointedly.

"Fair." He adjusted his backpack. "Do you think you'll stay after graduating? Or counting down the days?"

"Depends where I end up for college." I glanced at him. "You?"

"Somewhere in between. It's home, but it's also a lot of pressure. The legacy thing, the expectations." He paused. "Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to go somewhere no one knew my last name."

"Where would you go?"

"Somewhere different. Maybe west coast." He looked at me. "You?"

"Anywhere with a good soccer program and a full scholarship. Location doesn't matter as much as opportunity."

"That's practical."

"That's realistic."

We walked in silence, the conversation flowing naturally. No tactics, no team dynamics. Just... talking. Like regular people.

"Can I tell you something?" Garrett said eventually.

"Yeah."

"When you first joined the team, I thought there was no way you'd last. I figured you'd realize it was too hard, too hostile, and you'd quit."

I felt a flash of indignation. "Thanks for the vote of confidence."

"Let me finish." He held up a hand. "I was completely wrong. You're one of the most determined people I've ever met. You took everything—the cold shoulder, Derek's hostility, my resistance—and you just kept showing up and performing. That takes real strength."

The compliment caught me off guard. "I didn't really have a choice. Quitting wasn't an option."

"Everyone has a choice. You chose to fight for your place instead of walking away when it got hard. That says something about your character."

I didn't know how to respond to that, so I just said, "Thank you."

We'd reached the quad where our paths would diverge—his dorm was east, mine was west. We stopped, facing each other, and the conversation suddenly felt weighted with something unspoken.

"Same time Monday?" Garrett asked. "Practice, I mean."

"Yeah. Same time."

"Good." He hesitated, like he wanted to say something else, then seemed to think better of it. "Have a good weekend, Morgan."

"You too, Hayes."

I watched him walk away toward his dorm, then turned toward mine, my mind spinning. The hug during the celebration, the comfortable conversation, the way talking to him had felt easy in a way I hadn't expected.

When did that happen? When did Garrett Hayes become someone I could talk to comfortably? Someone whose presence didn't immediately put me on edge?

Kate was in our room when I got back and grinned at my face.

"What?"

"You look confused."

"I am confused."

"About?"

I sat on my bed. "Garrett and I just had this really comfortable conversation. We talked about school and college and life, and it was... easy."

"And that confuses you because...?"

"Because three weeks ago he barely acknowledged me. Two weeks ago we had that fight. And now we're designing plays together and having normal conversations and—" I stopped. "And he hugged me after the goal today."

Kate's eyebrows rose. "He hugged you?"

"Celebration hug. Very brief. Totally normal." Even as I said it, I knew it hadn't felt normal. "But there was this moment when he set me down, and it was..."

"Different," Kate finished.

"Yeah."

Kate studied me. "Riley. Do you like him?"

"I—what? No. He's my teammate. We just worked through conflict and now we're functioning like we should—"

"That's not what I asked."

I stopped. Did I like Garrett? The question felt impossible when our entire relationship had been defined by conflict.

But something had shifted. The conversation had felt good. The hug had made my heart race in a way that had nothing to do with the game.

"I don't know," I admitted. "I honestly don't know."

Kate smiled. "That's more honest than 'no.'"

That night, lying in bed, I replayed the day. The free kick play working perfectly. The celebration hug and that moment of awareness. The easy conversation walking across campus.

Something was changing between Garrett and me. Something beyond just resolving conflict.

And I had no idea what to do about it.

But for the first time since joining the boys' team, I wasn't worried about what came next. I was just curious. Open to whatever was developing.

Tomorrow we'd have another practice. Another opportunity to work together, to figure out what this partnership was becoming.

And that felt like exactly where I was supposed to be.
