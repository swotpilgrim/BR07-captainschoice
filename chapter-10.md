# Chapter 10: Breakthrough Kick

The week leading up to the Weston Academy game was tense. Garrett and I maintained professional distance—he gave instructions, I executed them, neither of us addressing the confrontation.

Connor noticed. "You two aren't talking."

"We talk when necessary."

"That's not what I mean." He fell into step beside me. "Look, this cold war thing isn't helping the team."

"I'm doing my job. I show up, I execute. What else do you want?"

"Keep offering your tactical insights, even if Garrett's being stubborn."

"Why? So he can shoot me down again?"

Connor stopped walking. "Because you're good at reading the field, Riley. Better than most of us. Eventually, Garrett's going to have to acknowledge that."

I wanted to believe him.

Friday's game against Weston Academy was marked on the calendar as a rivalry match. Weston was a neighboring prep school, similar academic prestige, equally serious athletics programs. The kind of game that mattered for bragging rights and conference standings.

The stands were packed Saturday afternoon. Rivalry game energy, electric and competitive.

I sat on the bench as the game started. Weston came out aggressive and physical—disciplined defense, quick transitions, dangerous.

The game was back and forth. Connor scored first, burying a through ball from Garrett. 1-0 Oakmont.

Weston equalized ten minutes later off a set piece. 1-1.

The physical play intensified. Bodies flying into tackles, yellow cards flashing. This was the kind of game decided by moments.

Weston scored again just before halftime. 2-1. We went into the locker room trailing.

Coach Bradley's halftime talk was pointed but calm. "Second half, we focus on what we do well. Quick combinations, exploiting space."

Ten minutes into the second half, Ben equalized with a powerful header. 2-2.

The game opened up, both teams pushing for a winner. The crowd noise building with each near-miss.

Then, with five minutes left, it happened.

Weston's defender took down Connor just outside the penalty box, thirty yards from goal. The referee's whistle shrieked, arm pointing to the spot of the foul. Dangerous free kick in my range.

Coach Bradley looked down the bench. "Morgan! You're in!"

I jumped up, checked in with the fourth official, and sprinted onto the field. My heart pounded, but my mind was already shifting into focus mode. Five minutes left. Score tied. This kick could win it.

At the spot of the foul, I picked up the ball and surveyed the situation while Weston organized their wall. Four defenders lining up, goalkeeper positioning himself, other players marking our forwards in the box.

This was everything I'd trained for. Every film session, every extra practice, every hour spent perfecting technique—it all came down to moments like this.

Garrett jogged over. I braced for instructions, for him to call the play and expect me to execute without input.

Instead, he asked, "What do you see?"

I looked at him, surprised. "What?"

"Their wall setup. What do you see?" His voice was urgent but not hostile. He genuinely wanted my read.

I looked back at the defensive formation, my tactical brain engaging immediately. "Wall is positioned for a straight shot. Four players, tight spacing. If I can curve it around the right edge with enough pace, there's a lane to the far post."

"Can you make that kick?"

"Yes."

"Connor," Garrett called, gesturing the forward over. "Make your run to the far post when Riley strikes. She's going to curve it around the right edge of the wall."

Connor nodded, getting into position.

Garrett met my eyes. "Trust your read. Execute what you see."

Then he jogged away to get out of the wall's range, leaving me with the ball and the opportunity.

I placed the ball carefully, stepped back to measure my approach. The crowd noise faded to background hum. The only things that mattered were the ball, the target, and the technique.

Twenty-five yards out. Four-player wall positioned for a straight shot. Far post vulnerable if I could curve it around the right edge with enough pace to beat the keeper's reaction.

I could make this kick. I knew I could.

Deep breath. Eyes on the ball. Visualize the path—up and around the wall's right edge, spinning with the curve, dropping toward the far post where Connor would be making his run.

I ran forward and struck the ball with the inside of my right foot, leaning into the curve, following through with my whole body. The contact felt perfect—solid, clean, the sweet spot.

The ball sailed up and over the right edge of the wall, spinning exactly the way I'd intended. The keeper reacted late, diving toward the far post but not fast enough.

Connor timed his run perfectly, breaking free from his marker and meeting the ball just as it dropped into the dangerous area. He redirected it with his head, a glancing touch that sent the ball past the diving keeper and into the back of the net.

Goal.

The stadium exploded. Our bench cleared, players rushing onto the field. Connor sprinted toward me, arms outstretched, and I found myself swept up in his hug, feet lifting off the ground briefly.

"Perfect ball!" he shouted over the noise. "Absolutely perfect!"

Other teammates mobbed us—Jordan, Ben, even players who'd been hesitant to accept me all piling into the celebration. The joy was genuine, unfiltered, the kind of moment that made all the difficulty worth it.

Through the chaos of bodies and noise, I saw Garrett. He stood a few feet away, and for a moment our eyes met. He gave me a small nod—just a brief dip of his chin, but the acknowledgment was clear.

That was the right call. You made the right play.

It wasn't forgiveness for our conflict. It wasn't friendship. But it was respect, hard-earned and undeniable.

---

The final five minutes were frantic. Weston pushed everyone forward, desperate for an equalizer. We defended with everything we had—bodies on the line, last-ditch tackles, Jordan making two brilliant saves in the final two minutes.

When the referee's whistle blew for full time, Oakmont 3, Weston 2, our team exploded in celebration again. First win of the season, and a rivalry match at that.

In the handshake line, Weston's players were gracious. Their captain told me, "Hell of a kick. Respect."

"Thanks. Good game."

Coach Bradley gathered us after. "That's the soccer I want to see. Composure under pressure, execution when it matters, trusting each other to do our jobs." He looked directly at me. "Morgan, that was elite-level execution. Exactly what we needed."

"Thank you, Coach."

In the locker area afterward, changing out of my game jersey, I could still hear the celebration continuing in the main locker room. Music playing, guys laughing and rehashing the game, the victorious energy that came with a hard-fought win.

Connor appeared in my doorway. "Team's grabbing dinner at the dining hall to celebrate. You should come."

"I don't want to intrude on—"

"You're not intruding. You're the reason we won. Come on."

At the dining hall, the team had claimed their usual table plus two additional tables pushed together to accommodate everyone. When I arrived with Connor and Jordan, there was actual space made for me—not reluctantly, but naturally.

I slid into a seat between Connor and Ben. Across the table, several teammates were already recounting the game-winning goal.

"—perfect curve, I've never seen anything like it—"

"—Connor's run was sick though, that timing—"

"—no, the kick made the play, if that ball's even six inches different it doesn't work—"

I ate my dinner listening to them dissect the play I'd made, feeling something unfamiliar: belonging.

Halfway through the meal, Garrett stood at the head of the table and raised his water glass. The team quieted.

"First win of the season," he said. "Hard-fought, earned it the right way. Everyone contributed." He paused, then looked directly at me. "Morgan made the play when we needed it. That's what teammates do."

It wasn't a flowery speech. Garrett didn't do flowery. But it was public acknowledgment, in front of the whole team, that I'd contributed something valuable.

"To the team," Garrett finished, raising his glass higher.

"To the team!" everyone echoed, glasses raised, the moment feeling significant in a way I couldn't quite articulate.

Walking back to my dorm, Kate linked her arm through mine. She'd been at the game.

"You were amazing. That free kick was perfect."

"Thanks. It felt good to contribute something that helped us win."

"More than contribute. You won the game."

"Connor scored. The whole team defended. I just placed one kick."

"Don't do that. Don't diminish what you did." Kate stopped walking. "You made a perfect kick under enormous pressure in the most important moment. Own that."

She was right. I had a tendency to deflect credit. But the truth was, I'd executed perfectly when it mattered most.

"Okay. I made a really good kick that helped us win."

"Thank you. Was that so hard?"

I smiled. "A little."

Back in our room, I lay in bed replaying the day. The pressure of the free kick, Garrett asking what I saw, the perfect contact, Connor's header, the celebration, the team dinner where I felt included.

One moment didn't erase all the difficulty. Garrett and I still had a complicated relationship, some teammates still viewed me skeptically, and I'd have to prove myself again.

But tonight, I'd proven something important: my tactical judgment was sound, my execution elite-level, and when the team trusted me to do my job, we won.

It was a start.
