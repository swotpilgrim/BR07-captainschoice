# Chapter 24: Cleared to Play

Dr. Morrison's examination room had become familiar over the past three weeks—the anatomical posters on the walls, the examination table with crinkly paper, the way afternoon light slanted through the window. But this visit felt different.

This was judgment day.

"Walk for me," Dr. Morrison said, watching as I crossed the room without crutches for what felt like the hundredth time.

I did, focusing on even weight distribution, no limping, normal gait. My ankle protested slightly—a dull ache rather than sharp pain—but it held.

"Now on your toes."

I rose up, balanced, came back down. Still holding.

"Full rotation, both directions."

I rotated my ankle through its complete range of motion. Not quite as smooth as my uninjured ankle, but functional.

Dr. Morrison made notes on his tablet, his expression giving nothing away. "How does it feel during the exercises?"

"Some discomfort, but manageable. Nothing sharp."

"And the strength training?"

"I'm back to about ninety percent of my pre-injury weight resistance."

More notes. More agonizing silence while he reviewed whatever medical criteria would determine my fate.

"Riley," he finally said, looking up. "I'm clearing you to play."

The relief hit so hard I had to sit down on the examination table.

"Really?"

"With conditions," he added. "The ankle needs to be taped for support before every game and practice. If you experience sharp pain at any point, you stop immediately—no playing through it. And I want you back here Monday after championship for a follow-up regardless of outcome."

"Yes. Absolutely. Whatever you need." I could barely process his words through the overwhelming joy flooding my system.

"You've done excellent work in physical therapy. Your dedication to the rehabilitation protocol is the only reason I feel comfortable clearing you this quickly." He handed me a printout with post-clearance instructions. "You're a talented athlete, Riley. Don't jeopardize your long-term health for one game."

"I won't," I promised. "Thank you. Seriously, thank you."

I practically floated out of his office, clutching the medical clearance form like it was made of gold.

I could play in championship.

After three weeks of uncertainty and frustration and fear, I was cleared to play.

Practice that afternoon felt like coming home.

I arrived early, changed in my usual converted coach's office, and walked onto the field where my team was already warming up. The moment they saw me in practice gear instead of sitting on the bench with crutches, Connor let out a whoop.

"Morgan's back!"

The team surrounded me, genuine smiles and congratulations that made my chest tight with gratitude. Even Derek grinned and said, "About time. Connor's corner kicks have been garbage."

"Hey!" Connor protested, but he was smiling too.

Coach Bradley approached, and I handed him the medical clearance form. He read it thoroughly, then looked at me with something like pride in his expression.

"Good to have you back, Morgan. We've got three days to get you match-fit. Let's not waste them."

"Yes, Coach."

He put me through gentle drills first, testing my mobility and confidence on the ankle. Basic passing, light jogging, change of direction exercises. The ankle held. It ached—would probably ache for a while—but it held.

Then set piece practice.

I lined up at my usual corner kick position, the ball at my feet, Connor positioned for the header. Muscle memory took over—three steps back, one to the side, visualize the trajectory, approach, plant, strike.

The ball curved perfectly through the air, finding Connor's head exactly where I'd intended. He redirected it into the goal, then turned to me with a huge grin.

"That's what I'm talking about! That's the placement we've been missing!"

We ran the drill again. And again. Each kick felt more natural, my confidence building with every successful execution. The ankle protested the repetitive stress, but nothing sharp, nothing that suggested re-injury.

Just the normal discomfort of pushing a recently healed injury back into athletic performance.

Garrett ran the practice as captain, positioning players and calling plays. Professional, focused, giving me no special treatment beyond the occasional question about how the ankle felt.

But when our eyes met across the field during a water break, the pride and relief in his expression said everything he couldn't say out loud.

I'm back, I thought. I'm really back.

---

Evening found me alone on the practice field, the sun setting and painting the sky in shades of orange and pink. I should have been resting my ankle, icing it, elevating it like Dr. Morrison's instructions specified.

Instead, I was here, practicing kicks in the gathering dusk.

I couldn't help it. Three weeks away from this field had made me hungry for it in a way I'd never experienced before. Every kick felt like reclaiming something I'd feared was lost.

"Knew I'd find you here."

I turned to find Garrett walking across the field toward me, carrying two water bottles and wearing that small smile that was becoming my favorite expression.

"You should know by now I have terrible impulse control when it comes to soccer," I said.

"One of your most endearing qualities." He handed me a water bottle. "How's the ankle really?"

"Sore. But good sore, if that makes sense. Like I'm using muscles that got lazy during recovery."

"That makes sense." Garrett looked up at the sky, now deepening toward twilight. "Three days until championship."

"I'll be ready."

"I know you will." He shifted closer, and in the empty field with darkness falling, we could finally drop the pretense of distance we maintained during practice. "Seeing you injured was one of the hardest things I've experienced. Not knowing if you'd heal in time, watching you struggle through physical therapy, seeing the fear in your eyes that you might miss the championship."

"It terrified me," I admitted. "Not just missing the game, but the idea that I might be remembered as the girl who got hurt and couldn't finish the season."

"You're going to be remembered as the girl who broke barriers and changed the program." Garrett's hand found mine. "The injury doesn't change that."

"Feels different now that I'm cleared to play." I looked down at our joined hands. "Less scary. Like I can actually believe we might win this."

"We will win this. With you on the field, we have everything we need."

"Even if my ankle isn't at full strength?"

"Your ninety percent is still better than most players' one hundred percent." He squeezed my hand. "Riley, you earned your place on this team in your first week. Everything since then has just been proving what was already true."

The conviction in his voice made my throat tight.

"Thank you," I said quietly. "For believing in me even when I didn't believe in myself."

"Always." Garrett pulled me closer, until we were standing face to face in the empty field under the darkening sky. "Can I tell you something?"

"Anything."

"When you got injured, I realized that you matter more to me than soccer. More than championship, more than scholarships, more than any of it." His hand came up to cup my face. "Don't get me wrong—I want to win championship. But what I want more is for you to be happy and healthy. Even if that meant you couldn't play, I'd still feel the same way about you."

My heart was pounding so hard I was sure he could hear it.

"The championship matters to me," I said. "But you're right—it's not everything anymore. Being with you, having this partnership we've built, the way we push each other to be better... that matters more than any game outcome."

"We've already won something," Garrett said softly. "Found each other in the middle of all this chaos."

"Yeah. We have."

The field lights flickered on—automatic timers activating as daylight faded—and suddenly we were illuminated in their glow. Alone on the field where we'd first clashed, then partnered, then fell for each other.

"Three more days until everyone can know about us," Garrett said, his thumb tracing my cheekbone.

"Three more days of pretending we're just teammates."

"For now." He leaned in slowly, giving me time to close the distance or pull away.

I closed the distance.

Our first kiss three weeks ago had been brief, tentative, both of us still processing the revelation of mutual feelings. But this kiss was different. Deeper, more certain, full of three weeks of stolen moments and secret smiles and the joy of having each other.

When we finally pulled apart, we were both smiling.

"Worth waiting for," Garrett said.

"Definitely."

We stood there together under the field lights, foreheads touching, savoring the moment. Around us, campus was settling into evening—lights appearing in dorm windows, the distant sound of students heading to dinner, the normal rhythms of Oakmont life.

But here, in our world, it was just us.

"We should get you back to your dorm," Garrett said eventually. "Ankle needs rest."

"Probably." But I didn't move.

"Riley."

"Fine, fine. Being responsible." I stepped back reluctantly. "But for the record, I'd much rather stay here with you."

"Three days," he reminded me, lacing his fingers through mine as we started walking toward the dorms. "Three days of championship preparation, then one game that determines everything. Then everyone can know."

"Can't wait."

"Me either."

He walked me to my dorm, and we parted with careful distance in case anyone was watching. But the smile he gave me before turning away carried all the warmth and affection we had to keep hidden.

Back in my room, Kate took one look at my face and grinned. "Doctor cleared you to play?"

"Yes."

"And you saw Garrett after practice?"

"Maybe."

"You're glowing, Riley. Like, literally glowing. It's disgusting and adorable."

I collapsed onto my bed, ankle elevated on pillows, ice pack positioned properly, doctor's orders finally being followed. "Three days until championship."

"Three days until you and Garrett can stop sneaking around."

"That too."

Kate settled at her desk with her homework. "For what it's worth, I think you two are good together. He makes you happy."

"He does."

"And you make him less uptight."

"So I've heard."

We sat in comfortable silence, Kate working on her Spanish homework, me reviewing plays in my mind for championship. My ankle throbbed dully, reminding me it was still healing. But I was cleared to play.

That was all that mattered.

Three days until everything changed.

Three days until championship.

Three days until Garrett and I could finally be together publicly.

I could wait three more days.

With him, I could wait forever.
