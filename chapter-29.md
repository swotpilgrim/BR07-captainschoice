# Chapter 29: The Kiss

Monday's school assembly felt like a victory lap. The entire student body packed into the auditorium, the championship trophy displayed prominently on stage, our team seated in the front rows wearing our jerseys with pride.

Headmaster Williams stood at the podium, his voice carrying through the sound system. "It gives me tremendous pleasure to honor our state championship soccer team. Their victory represents not just athletic excellence, but the values Oakmont Academy holds dear—dedication, teamwork, and the courage to embrace positive change."

Applause filled the auditorium.

"This season, we took a historic step by adding a female player to our boys' varsity team. Some questioned whether this innovation would succeed. Our team answered definitively: excellence transcends traditional boundaries."

The headmaster called each player to the stage to receive special recognition. When my name was announced, the applause was thunderous. I walked onto the stage, shook the headmaster's hand, accepted the "Breakthrough Player of the Year" award.

Standing there looking out at the entire school, I felt the magnitude of what I'd accomplished. Three months ago, I'd been the controversial addition to the team. Now I was being celebrated as an essential contributor to championship success.

Garrett received conference MVP honors, and the pride in his expression as he accepted was unmistakable. When our eyes met from opposite sides of the stage, the connection between us felt electric.

After the assembly, students poured into the hallways, everyone congratulating the team. I was swept into conversations, accepting praise and answering questions about the championship game. The attention was overwhelming but validating.

Through the crowd, I saw Garrett making his way toward me with clear determination.

"Riley," he said when he reached me. "Can we talk? Privately?"

We found a quieter hallway near the language classrooms, away from the post-assembly chaos.

"I don't want to hide anymore," Garrett said without preamble. "We proved ourselves. The championship, the recognition, everything. No one can question that you earned your place or that our relationship is anything other than two people who respect and care about each other."

"I know. I feel the same way."

"So let's tell them. Today, at practice. In front of the whole team." He stepped closer. "Let's stop hiding what we are to each other."

My heart was racing, but not from fear. From anticipation.

"Okay," I said. "Let's do it."

Garrett smiled, and in that moment, I saw everything we'd overcome reflected back at me—the initial hostility, the gradual partnership, the feelings we'd finally acknowledged, the championship we'd won together.

"See you at practice," he said.

"See you there."

Practice that afternoon felt different. The team was still celebrating championship victory, spirits high and energy positive. But I could feel the anticipation building as four o'clock approached—the time Garrett had announced for the team meeting.

We gathered in the film room after warmups, all thirty players squeezing into the space designed for analysis and strategy sessions. Coach Bradley was absent—Garrett had specifically said this was a player-only meeting.

Connor was grinning like he knew exactly what was coming. Jordan looked curious. Derek appeared mildly interested. The rest of the team settled into seats, waiting.

Garrett stood at the front, and I stood beside him. Our position together was already somewhat telling.

"Thanks for coming," Garrett started. "I wanted to gather everyone because there's something Riley and I need to tell you officially, even though most of you have probably already guessed."

Connor made an exaggerated gesture of shock. "You're secretly robots? I knew it!"

Laughter broke the tension.

Garrett smiled, then became serious again. "Riley and I have been dating. We kept it private through championship because we didn't want anyone questioning whether her position on this team had anything to do with our relationship. But now that the season's over and we've won championship with Riley's contributions proven beyond doubt, we wanted to be honest with our teammates."

The room was quiet for about three seconds.

Then Connor started slow-clapping. "Finally! Do you know how painful it's been watching you two make eyes at each other while pretending you're just teammates?"

Jordan joined the applause, then Derek, then the entire team. Not mocking or skeptical—genuinely supportive.

"For the record," Connor continued, "we all knew. Or at least strongly suspected. You're terrible at hiding it."

"Apparently," I said, feeling my face heat but also feeling overwhelming relief.

"But seriously," Jordan added, "you two are good together. And Morgan earned her spot on this team long before any relationship started. Anyone who suggests otherwise is an idiot who doesn't understand soccer."

Derek stood, which was unexpected enough that the room quieted. "I gave Morgan a hard time when she first joined. I was wrong, and I've said so. She proved herself through skill and guts. If the captain wants to date her, that's his business and hers. Won't change the fact that she's one of the best set piece specialists I've seen."

The endorsement from Derek—who'd been my harshest critic initially—meant more than he probably knew.

"Thanks, Palmer," I managed.

"Don't let it go to your head, Morgan." But he was almost smiling.

Coach Bradley appeared in the doorway. "I heard there was a team announcement?"

"Coach." Garrett straightened. "Riley and I wanted the team to know we're dating. We kept it private during championship to avoid any questions about her position, but we're going public now."

Coach looked between us, then shrugged. "As long as it doesn't affect team performance, your personal lives are your own business. Though I will say—" he paused for effect, "—you weren't as subtle as you thought. I've been expecting this conversation since the injury."

Even Coach had known. We really had been terrible at hiding it.

"Now get out on the field," Coach continued. "Championship or not, we still have practice."

---

Practice was light—celebratory rather than intense, Coach letting us enjoy victory while maintaining some conditioning. As we ran through drills, teammates kept making knowing comments or grinning at me and Garrett when we interacted.

It felt good. Natural. Right.

After practice, as the team headed to showers, Garrett caught my hand. "Stay back for a minute?"

We stood on the field as the others left, the same field where we'd first clashed months ago. Where I'd proven myself in tryouts, where I'd practiced hundreds of corner kicks, where we'd developed the partnership that became something more.

"On this field," Garrett said, "I first resented your presence. Thought you'd be a distraction and a liability."

"And now?"

"Now I can't imagine the season—or my life—without you." He pulled me closer, his hands settling at my waist. "I love you, Riley Morgan. And I don't care who knows it."

"I love you too."

He kissed me then, in the middle of the practice field with late afternoon sun casting long shadows and anyone who looked could see. Not hidden, not secret, not careful.

Just two people who'd found each other in the most unexpected way, kissing where everyone could see.

When we pulled apart, I heard applause.

The team had come back out of the locker rooms, standing at the field's edge, clapping and cheering with genuine happiness.

"About damn time!" Connor shouted.

Garrett laughed, keeping one arm around my waist as we faced our team—our teammates who'd become friends, who'd supported us through championship and now supported us in this.

"Show's over!" Garrett called. "Go shower!"

But they kept clapping until we both bowed dramatically, which made them laugh and finally disperse.

Standing there with Garrett's arm around me, surrounded by the team's approval and acceptance, I felt complete in a way I'd never experienced before.

I'd earned respect through skill and performance.

I'd helped win a state championship.

I'd opened doors for other female athletes.

And I'd found love with someone who challenged me and supported me equally.

"Happy?" Garrett asked quietly.

"So happy."

"Me too." He pressed a kiss to my temple. "Come on. Let's get showered and changed. I want to take you to dinner. Publicly. Like an actual date where everyone can see we're together."

"Best idea you've had all day."

"Second best," he corrected. "Best was kissing you on this field where everyone could see."

I couldn't argue with that.

That evening, Garrett and I walked through campus holding hands, no longer hiding or maintaining careful distance. Students who saw us smiled or called out congratulations—on the championship, on the relationship, on everything.

Kate texted: *Finally! So proud of you for being brave enough to be public.*

Alex sent: *Saw you two walking across campus. You look happy. You deserve it.*

Even my parents called after I texted them about going public with Garrett. My dad was protective but ultimately supportive—"He better treat you well or he'll answer to me." My mom was delighted—"Honey, I'm so happy for you. You've accomplished so much this season."

We ended up at the campus cafe, sharing a corner booth and talking about everything—college plans, scholarship details, next semester when we'd both be at Oakmont without the pressure of championship hanging over us.

"Penn State's looking more likely," Garrett said. "Their men's program is strong, scholarship offer is good, and being on the same campus as you doesn't hurt."

"Same. The women's program coordinator seemed genuinely excited about recruiting me. Full scholarship, starting position, excellent facilities."

"We could make it work," Garrett said. "Different teams, but same campus. See each other between practices and games. Actually date properly without sneaking around."

"I really want that," I admitted.

"Me too."

We sat together as evening turned to night, planning a future that included both our soccer ambitions and our relationship. Not compromising one for the other, but finding ways to pursue both.

It felt possible. Real. Right.

And when Garrett walked me back to my dorm and kissed me goodnight on the front steps where anyone could see, I felt the same joy and rightness.

This was who we were now. Partners on and off the field. Athletes pursuing our dreams. Two people who'd found each other and were brave enough to fight for both their ambitions and their relationship.

I'd come to Oakmont to play soccer.

I'd found so much more.

And it was only the beginning.
