# Chapter 3: Tryouts

Thursday arrived with perfect September weather—clear skies, temperature in the low seventies, just enough breeze to matter for kick trajectory but not enough to be unpredictable. I'd checked the weather forecast three times that morning like it would somehow change.

Classes crawled by. I took notes mechanically in English, barely tasted my lunch, and definitely didn't absorb anything in chemistry. Kate kept shooting me encouraging looks across the lab table while we measured solutions, but my mind was already on the field, visualizing my approach angles and follow-through.

When the final bell rang, I headed straight for the athletics complex. I'd changed into my practice gear during lunch—black athletic shorts, fitted tank top, hair pulled back tight in a French braid that wouldn't come loose. My cleats were cleaned, laces double-knotted the way I always did before important games.

The boys' varsity field looked even more impressive up close than it did from a distance. The grass was perfect, trimmed to ideal height, the lines freshly painted. Real goals with nets that weren't torn or sagging. I took a steadying breath, trying to channel my dad's voice: Trust your preparation. Block out the noise.

Girls were already arriving, stretching on the sideline. I recognized a few from other sports—there was Maria from the track team, and wasn't that Jordan's sister who played lacrosse? About twenty in total by the time Coach Bradley walked onto the field carrying a clipboard and a bag of balls.

The boys' varsity team was assembling near the far sideline, ostensibly for their own practice but clearly there to watch. I forced myself not to look at them, focusing instead on my hamstring stretch.

"All right, ladies," Coach Bradley called out. He was probably late forties, fit in the way former athletes stayed fit, with a no-nonsense demeanor that reminded me of my dad. "Thanks for coming out. I'm going to be evaluating pure technical skill today—accuracy, power, consistency. This isn't about politics or making a statement. I need a specialist who can execute in high-pressure game situations. If that's you, show me."

I appreciated the directness. No speeches about innovation or opportunity, just soccer.

"We'll start with accuracy drills. You'll take corner kicks from both sides, aiming for targets I'll place in the box. Then free kicks from various distances and angles. Finally, penalty shots. I'll narrow the field as we go. Questions?"

No one spoke.

"Good. Let's see what you've got."

He divided us into two groups. I ended up in the second group, which meant standing and watching while the first ten girls took their attempts. It was torture—the waiting, the watching, the mental energy of staying focused while nervous energy built in my chest.

I watched each attempt with a player's eye, noting approach angles and contact points. Some girls had power but not precision. Others had decent technique but lacked consistency.

"Second group, you're up."

My turn. I grabbed a ball and jogged to the corner arc on the right side. Placed the ball carefully, stepped back to measure my approach. From the sideline, I could feel eyes on me—the other girls, Coach Bradley, the boys' team in the distance.

I blocked it all out. Just me and the ball and the target.

Four steps back, two to the left. Deep breath. Eyes on my target—the near post area where Coach had placed a marker. I visualized the curve I wanted, the height, the spin that would take it exactly where I aimed.

Then I ran forward and struck the ball with the inside of my right foot, leaning back slightly for height, following through with my whole leg.

The ball curved beautifully, spinning toward the near post. It dropped exactly where I'd aimed, right onto the marker.

"Good placement, Morgan," Coach Bradley said, making a note on his clipboard. "Other side."

I jogged to the left corner. This was my slightly weaker side, but I'd spent hours practicing to make it nearly as reliable as my right. Same routine: place the ball, measure approach, visualize the path.

The kick felt clean coming off my foot. The ball arced high, curving in toward the far post, and dropped into the target zone. Not quite as perfect as the right side, but solid.

"Next drill," Coach called after everyone had attempted from both sides. "Free kicks. Thirty yards out, center of the field. I want to see power and accuracy. We'll have a wall, so you'll need to get it up and over or bend it around."

He'd set up a wall of practice dummies, forcing us to actually curve the ball rather than just strike it straight. Smart—game situations always had walls to navigate.

The first group went again. I studied how the successful kicks curved, where the unsuccessful ones went wrong. Too much power and not enough spin sent kicks sailing over the crossbar. Too much caution and the wall blocked them.

When my turn came, I approached the ball with confidence. I'd spent Tuesday and Wednesday evenings practicing exactly this type of kick. My dad had taught me years ago: strike across the ball, not straight through it. Make it spin.

I struck it with the inside of my foot, leaning into the curve. The ball sailed up and over the right edge of the wall, spinning as it went, then dipped toward the upper corner of the goal. The keeper Coach had positioned there—one of the boys from the varsity team—had to fully extend to tip it over the bar.

"Nice shot, Morgan," the keeper said as he tossed the ball back. I recognized him vaguely from around campus but couldn't remember his name.

"Thanks."

After another round of free kicks from different angles, Coach Bradley called us together. "I'm narrowing to three finalists. If I call your name, stay. Everyone else, I appreciate you coming out."

He read two names I didn't recognize, then: "Riley Morgan."

Relief and fresh nervousness hit simultaneously. Final three.

"Final evaluation," Coach Bradley said. "Game situation. My varsity team is going to run a scrimmage. Each of you will demonstrate set pieces in real scenarios."

He blew his whistle, and the boys' team took the field. This was it—the real test.

The scrimmage started. I stood on the sideline with the other two finalists, waiting. The first girl's corner kick was decent but not dangerous—easily cleared. The second girl's free kick had good power but poor timing with the players' runs.

Then Coach signaled me in.

"Corner kick, left side," he said. "Make it count."

I jogged onto that perfect grass, hyperaware of everything—the boys' team in their practice jerseys, the coaches watching, the importance of this moment. At the corner arc, I picked up the ball and placed it carefully.

Then I looked up and actually read the situation like I would in a real game. The players in the box, their positioning, who was marking whom. I saw a tall forward—number 12 according to his jersey—making a run toward the near post, his defender half a step behind.

Near post, driven hard with pace. That's what the situation called for.

I took my approach and struck the ball exactly how I'd visualized it. Low and hard, curving in toward the near post with enough pace that it would be difficult to handle. Number 12 timed his run perfectly, getting his head to the ball just ahead of his defender.

Goal.

The ball hit the back of the net, and for a moment everything stopped. Then number 12—a senior with an easy grin—jogged over and held up his hand for a high five.

"Perfect ball," he said. "Seriously, that was exactly where I needed it."

"Thanks." I tried to keep my expression neutral, but inside I was flying. That was the kind of assist you dream about—reading the situation correctly, executing the kick perfectly, creating an actual goal.

I jogged off the field, heart pounding. The other two finalists both looked deflated, like they knew.

Coach Bradley let the scrimmage run for another few minutes, then blew his whistle and gathered everyone.

"All three of you demonstrated real skill," he said to the finalists. "You should all be proud of how you performed today. But I can only select one player for this position."

He paused, and the silence stretched out. I focused on breathing steadily.

"Riley Morgan, the position is yours if you want it."

If I wanted it. Like there was any question.

"Yes, sir. I want it."

"Welcome to varsity. Report to practice tomorrow at three-thirty. We'll get you fitted for uniforms and practice gear." He turned to the boys' team, most of whom had stopped their scrimmage to listen. "This is Riley Morgan. She's your new set piece specialist. She earned this position the same way you earned yours—by being the best player available. I expect you to treat her accordingly."

Scattered applause from the team. The tall forward who'd scored off my corner kick—Connor, I heard someone call him—stepped forward with a genuine smile.

"Welcome to the team. I'm Connor Mitchell. Looking forward to more of those perfect crosses."

"Riley Morgan. Thanks."

A few other players offered nods and quick handshakes. But I noticed others holding back, expressions neutral or actively unfriendly.

And the player wearing number 7—the team captain based on how the others oriented toward him—stood with his arms crossed and his jaw tight. He offered no welcome, no acknowledgment at all. Just watched me with an expression I couldn't quite read. Not hostility exactly, but definitely not approval.

That must be Garrett Hayes.

I met his gaze steadily, refusing to look away first. I'd earned this position. I belonged here.

Finally, he looked away, turning back to his teammates.

Coach dismissed us, and I walked off the field on shaky legs. I'd done it. I'd made the boys' varsity team.

Kate was waiting at the edge of the field. She grabbed me in a fierce hug.

"You were amazing! That corner kick was perfect!"

"Thanks for coming."

"How do you feel?"

"Honestly? Kind of terrified."

I glanced back at the field, where the boys' team was running cooldown laps. The captain—Garrett—kept his eyes straight ahead.

"Good terrified or bad terrified?"

"Both," I admitted. "Definitely both."
