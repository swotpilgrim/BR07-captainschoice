# Chapter 27: Victory Celebration

The trophy was heavier than I expected.

Gold-plated, mounted on a wooden base with "STATE CHAMPIONS" engraved across the front, it passed from player to player as we posed for what felt like hundreds of photos. Media cameras flashed, parents cheered, scouts watched from the sidelines taking notes.

When the trophy reached me, Connor and Jordan lifted me onto their shoulders, and the crowd erupted. I held the championship trophy above my head, ankle throbbing and completely ignored, heart so full of joy I could barely breathe.

"MORGAN! MORGAN! MORGAN!" the chant started from our student section and spread through the crowd.

This was real. We'd actually won.

The trophy presentation happened in a blur of confetti and celebration. Our team lined up, each player receiving a championship medal. When the coordinator placed mine around my neck, the weight of it felt like vindication—proof that I'd earned my place here, that the skeptics had been wrong, that skill and determination mattered more than outdated assumptions.

Garrett stood beside me for the team photo, both of us holding the trophy together with our teammates. In the chaos of celebration, his hand briefly touched mine behind the trophy where the cameras couldn't see. A private moment of connection amid the public victory.

"We did it," he said quietly, meant only for me.

"We really did."

The media descended after trophy presentation, microphones and cameras surrounding Coach Bradley and Garrett as team representatives.

"Coach, how does it feel to win the state championship?" a reporter asked.

"Incredible. This team has worked tremendously hard all season. They've shown discipline, teamwork, and an ability to adapt that's rare at this level." Coach's voice carried pride and satisfaction.

"The co-ed innovation was controversial when you announced it. Do you consider it a success?"

"I consider it essential to building the best possible team. Riley Morgan earned her position through skill and proved her value all season. Her set piece contributions were crucial to our success, including the championship-winning goal. This victory validates what we've known all along—talent has no gender."

More questions, more analysis of the game and season. Then a reporter turned to Garrett.

"As team captain, how do you feel about the co-ed addition to your squad?"

Garrett's answer came without hesitation. "Riley is one of the most talented and dedicated players I've had the privilege of playing alongside. When she first joined the team, I was skeptical. I'm not proud of that, but I'm honest about it. She proved me wrong through consistent excellence and mental toughness that exceeded most players I know."

He paused, and when he continued, his voice held unmistakable sincerity. "Riley's courage in joining this team, her skill in contributing to our success, and her character in handling pressure and scrutiny have made us all better. This championship belongs to her as much as anyone."

Listening from the edge of the media scrum, I felt my throat tighten. Garrett's public acknowledgment of my value—after everything we'd been through—meant more than I could articulate.

A reporter noticed me and called out: "Riley! How does it feel to be part of the championship team?"

I stepped forward, suddenly facing multiple microphones. "It feels amazing. This team welcomed me eventually, trusted me, and we worked together toward a common goal. The championship is the culmination of everyone's effort."

"You scored the game-winning assist. Take us through that moment."

"I saw an opportunity for our goalkeeper to attack the near post. Garrett trusted my tactical read and positioned the team perfectly. The kick execution was mine, but the play was collaborative—that's been the story of our season."

"What does this mean for female athletes hoping to compete at higher levels?"

The question hung in the air, weighted with implications beyond just soccer.

"I hope it means they'll try," I said carefully. "That they won't accept limitations based on outdated assumptions. That they'll work hard, prove themselves, and demand opportunities based on merit. There will be resistance and skepticism, but if you're skilled and determined enough, you can earn your place."

More questions followed, but eventually the media shifted focus to other players, and I escaped back to my celebrating teammates.

A scout approached me as I was heading toward the team bus.

"Riley Morgan?" She extended a business card. "Jennifer Chen, Division I recruitment coordinator for Penn State women's soccer program."

My heart skipped. Penn State was one of the top women's programs in the country.

"We've been following your season with interest," she continued. "Your technical skills are impressive, but what really stands out is your mental game—tactical awareness, composure under pressure, ability to perform in crucial moments. That championship-winning assist was textbook execution."

"Thank you," I managed.

"We'd like to discuss recruitment opportunities. Full scholarship, starting position available for someone with your talents." She handed me the card. "Contact me when you're ready to talk details. But know that Penn State is very interested in having you join our program."

After she left, I stood there holding the business card, trying to process what had just happened.

Full scholarship. Division I soccer. Everything I'd worked toward my entire life, offered because of what I'd accomplished this season.

"Good news?" Kate appeared beside me, grinning.

"Penn State wants to recruit me. Full scholarship."

Kate screamed and hugged me. "Riley! That's incredible!"

It was incredible. It was everything.

And I'd earned it.

The team gathered at a local restaurant for celebratory dinner, the private room rented out by the school echoing with laughter and victory speeches. Pizza and wings and sodas, comfort food consumed by exhausted athletes riding the high of championship victory.

Connor stood and raised his glass—plastic cup of Coke, but the gesture was formal. "To the best damn soccer team in the state!"

Everyone cheered, cups raised.

Derek stood next. "To Morgan, for proving me wrong and making us better!"

More cheers, and I felt my face heat as teammates pounded the table in agreement.

Garrett stood last, and the room quieted. "To every player who contributed this season. To Coach Bradley for believing in us. To Riley for having the courage to break barriers and the skill to excel. And to all of us, for learning what it means to be a real team."

The celebration continued late into the evening, stories retold and embellished, the championship game analyzed from every angle. I sat between Garrett and Connor, accepted into the brotherhood without question or qualification.

Just another player celebrating victory.

Except when Garrett's foot touched mine under the table, a secret connection amid public celebration, reminding me that tomorrow everything would change.

As the dinner wound down and we headed to the buses back to Oakmont, Garrett fell into step beside me.

"Can we talk?" he asked quietly. "Privately?"

We let the team board ahead of us, lingering in the parking lot under streetlights.

"You played brilliantly today," Garrett said. "That championship-winning assist was perfect."

"Your positioning made it possible. You trusted my tactical read."

"I always trust you." He stepped closer, and in the shadows between streetlights, we had a moment of privacy. "Riley, this championship belongs to you. Your courage, your skill, your determination. You changed this program, changed the team, changed... me."

"You changed too," I said. "From resisting my presence to becoming my partner. That meant everything."

"Tomorrow, everyone can know we're together. No more hiding, no more pretending." His hand found mine. "How does that feel?"

"Scary. Exciting. Right." I squeezed his hand. "I'm ready for people to know."

"Me too." He pulled me into a quick hug, brief enough to be plausibly friendly but long enough that I felt the emotion behind it. "We won today. On the field and off it."

"Yeah. We did."

The bus horn honked—Coach Bradley's not-so-subtle reminder that we needed to get moving.

We separated and boarded with appropriate distance, but I carried the warmth of Garrett's words and touch with me.

Tomorrow, our relationship would become public.

But tonight, we were champions, and that was enough.

Back at Oakmont, the campus had stayed up waiting for us. Students lined the path from the bus to the dorms, cheering and congratulating us as we walked through. Someone had hung a banner across the main building: "STATE CHAMPIONS."

I limped toward my dorm with Kate beside me, ankle finally making its discomfort known after hours of adrenaline had worn off.

"You should ice that," Kate said.

"I will. But first, I need to process that we actually won."

"You won. You personally contributed the game-winning assist. Penn State offered you a scholarship. And tomorrow you get to go public with your relationship. This might be the best day of your life."

She wasn't wrong.

In my room, I elevated my ankle and applied ice like Dr. Morrison had taught me. The championship medal hung around my neck, too precious to take off yet. The Penn State scout's business card sat on my desk, promise of a future I'd fought for.

And somewhere in the boys' dorm, Garrett was probably doing the same thing—icing whatever injuries he'd sustained, wearing his medal, processing victory.

Tomorrow, we'd celebrate together. Publicly.

But tonight, I sat alone in satisfied exhaustion, replaying the championship game and everything that had led to this moment.

I'd joined the boys' team to access better resources and recruitment opportunities.

I'd earned a championship medal and a Division I scholarship offer.

But along the way, I'd found something I hadn't been looking for—a partner who challenged me and supported me, who respected me and cared for me beyond soccer.

Tomorrow, everyone would know about Garrett and me.

I couldn't wait.
