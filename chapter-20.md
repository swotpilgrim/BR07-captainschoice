# Chapter 20: The Injury

Millbrook Academy played dirty. Everyone knew it going into the game.

"Watch number fourteen," Jordan called during warmups. "He's got a reputation for late challenges."

I filed the information away and focused on my preparation. My specialized role meant coming off the bench when set piece opportunities arose, so I needed to be ready instantly.

The game started physical. Millbrook's defensive strategy involved fouling just hard enough to disrupt rhythm without drawing cards. Late tackles, elbows during headers, ignored warnings.

By halftime, we were tied 1-1, and three of our players were nursing minor injuries.

"They're trying to intimidate us," Garrett said in the huddle, his captain's voice carrying authority even as his jaw was tight with controlled anger. "Don't retaliate. Play our game, stay disciplined, and we'll break through their defense."

The second half was worse. Connor took an elbow to the face that should have been a red card but only drew a yellow. Derek got clipped from behind.

In the seventy-second minute, we earned a corner kick.

Coach Bradley signaled me in.

I jogged onto the field, trading places with our midfielder, trying to ignore the hostile energy from Millbrook's players and their crowd. Focus on execution. Trust preparation. Block out everything else.

Garrett met me at the corner flag, positioning the team for the kick. "Far post," he said quietly. "Connor's got height advantage on their defender."

I nodded, surveying the defense. Millbrook had packed bodies into the box, clearly expecting the corner kick and determined to prevent anything from developing. Their marking was tight, aggressive, hands grabbing jerseys in ways the referee wasn't catching.

I placed the ball, stepped back to measure my approach. Took a breath.

The whistle blew.

I ran forward, struck the ball with the outside of my foot to create the curve Connor needed. The kick arced beautifully toward the far post, exactly where I'd aimed.

Connor jumped, timing his run perfectly.

And then someone's legs swept through mine from behind.

I'd been following through on my kick, weight already committed forward, when the impact came. My feet went out from under me and I had no time to catch myself. I went down hard, the ground rushing up to meet me.

The impact drove the air from my lungs. But worse was my ankle—I'd landed on it wrong, felt something twist sharply as my momentum carried me over.

Pain exploded through my lower leg, bright and immediate.

I heard the referee's whistle, shrill and insistent. Heard shouting from our bench. But it all felt distant, muffled by the ringing in my ears and the sickening throb in my ankle.

"Riley!"

Hands on my shoulders, someone kneeling beside me. I blinked, trying to focus, and found Garrett's face above mine. His expression was stripped of all captainly composure, showing raw fear.

"Are you okay? Riley, talk to me."

I tried to sit up, but his hand on my shoulder kept me down. "Stay still. Trainer's coming."

"My ankle," I managed, voice coming out thinner than I wanted. "I landed on it wrong."

Garrett's eyes flicked down to my left ankle, and whatever he saw there made his jaw clench even tighter. "Don't move it. Just stay still."

Around us, I became aware of the chaos. Our team surrounding us in a protective circle. Millbrook's players arguing with the referee about the call. The opposing player who'd undercut me—number fourteen, the one Jordan had warned about—was being shown a yellow card, though it should have been red.

"Deliberate foul," I heard Connor's voice, angry and loud. "He went through her from behind after the kick was already away!"

"Penalty kick," the referee announced, pointing to the spot.

But I barely registered it. The training staff had arrived, Coach Bradley's assistant kneeling on my other side, gently examining my ankle. Even his careful touch made me wince.

"Ankle sprain," he said grimly. "Maybe worse. We need to get you off the field so I can examine it properly."

"I can walk," I started to say, but when I tried to put weight on it, pain shot through my leg so intensely my vision went white at the edges.

"No walking," the trainer said firmly. "Garrett, Connor, help me get her to the sideline."

Strong hands lifted me, supporting me on either side. I caught flashes of the walk to the bench—Garrett's face close to mine, tight with worry; Connor's encouraging murmur about being okay; the hostile jeers from Millbrook's crowd that I tried to block out.

They settled me on the bench, and the trainer immediately went to work. Ice, elevation, gentle manipulation to test range of motion. Each movement sent fresh waves of pain through my ankle.

I watched the rest of the game through a haze of pain and frustration. Jordan, our goalkeeper, took the penalty kick and buried it. 2-1, Oakmont. The final eighteen minutes felt eternal. Millbrook threw everything forward, desperate to equalize, but our defense held.

The final whistle blew. We'd won.

But sitting on the bench with my ankle already swelling grotesquely despite the ice, the victory felt hollow.

---

After the game, while our team went through the handshake line, I remained on the bench with ice wrapped around my ankle. Through the crowd of players, I heard Millbrook's number fourteen talking to one of his teammates.

"Guess she's not tough enough for boys' soccer after all," he said, loud enough to carry.

His teammate laughed. "Probably faking it for attention anyway."

White-hot anger flared through me, momentarily overriding the pain. I started to stand—to say what, I didn't know—but someone beat me to it.

"You want to say that again?"

Derek Palmer stood in front of the Millbrook players, his usually smirking expression replaced with genuine rage.

"I said—" number fourteen started.

"That was a dirty play and you know it," Derek cut him off. "You went through her from behind, well after the ball was away. If the ref had any guts, you'd have been sent off."

"It's just soccer," the Millbrook player said dismissively. "Maybe she should stick to the girls' team if she can't handle it."

"She's taken harder hits than that all season and kept playing," Derek said, voice deadly quiet. "That foul was deliberate and cowardly. Own it."

Connor appeared beside Derek, and then Jordan. A wall of Oakmont players, united.

"We good here?" Connor asked pleasantly, but there was steel underneath the friendly tone.

The Millbrook players backed off, muttering, but they left.

Derek turned back toward our bench, caught my eye, and gave a curt nod before heading to the locker room. Not friendly, exactly, but acknowledging. Teammate protecting teammate.

I sat there, surprised and oddly touched.

---

The locker rooms at Millbrook were segregated like at most away fields, which meant while my team showered and changed, I sat alone in the small athletic training room with ice and elevation.

A knock on the door.

"Come in," I called, expecting the trainer.

Garrett appeared instead, hair still damp from a quick shower, in clean clothes. His face was carefully controlled, but I could see the anger simmering beneath the surface.

"How bad?" he asked without preamble.

"Trainer thinks moderate sprain. Won't know for sure until I see the team doctor tomorrow." I gestured at my elevated ankle, ice pack wrapped around it making it look twice its normal size. "Probably out for at least two weeks."

Garrett's hands clenched into fists at his sides. "That foul was dirty. He should have been ejected."

"Yellow card for undercutting someone's legs from behind during a set piece. Ridiculous." My own anger was building now, fed by his. "He did it deliberately. He knew exactly what he was doing."

"I know." Garrett moved closer, his eyes scanning my elevated ankle like he could assess the damage through the ice. "When you went down..." He stopped, jaw working. "I've never been that scared during a game before."

"I'm okay," I said automatically.

"You're not okay. You're injured and in pain, and it happened because some player decided hurting you was worth a yellow card."

"Garrett—"

"You could have been hurt worse. If you'd landed on your neck instead of your ankle..." He stopped himself, taking a breath. When he looked at me again, something raw showed in his eyes. "Seeing you on the ground like that, not moving for those first few seconds—"

"I'm okay," I said again, more gently this time. "Ankle sprain sucks, but I'll recover. I've been injured before."

"Not since joining our team."

"No," I acknowledged. "But it was bound to happen eventually. Soccer's a physical sport."

Garrett pulled a chair over, sitting down so we were at eye level. "The way you handled it—you were so calm. I was ready to fight number fourteen, but you just focused on getting the injury assessed."

"Fighting him wouldn't have helped my ankle heal faster," I pointed out.

"I know. But I wanted to anyway." He ran his hand through his hair. "Derek defending you surprised me."

"Yeah. Me too."

"Team's really unified now. Even Derek recognizes you're one of us." Garrett's voice softened. "Watching you get hurt made everyone realize how much we've come to rely on you. How much you matter to this team."

"Even injured and useless?"

"You're not useless. You'll heal and come back." His eyes held mine. "And in the meantime, we'll hold things together until you can play again."

The we in that sentence felt significant. Not just the team—but him and me, specifically.

"Championship game is three weeks away," I said quietly. "If this is a two-week injury, I might make it back in time."

"Don't rush recovery," Garrett said immediately. "I'd rather have you healthy for playoffs than risk permanent damage pushing too fast."

"Spoken like a captain."

"Spoken like someone who cares about you," he said quietly.

The admission hung between us in the small training room. Outside, I could hear our team loading equipment onto the bus, the usual post-game chaos of an away victory. But in here, it was just the two of us and everything we still weren't quite saying.

"I care about you too," I admitted. "That's why getting injured feels so frustrating. I want to be out there helping the team. Helping you."

"You've already helped more than you know." Garrett reached out, his hand covering mine where it rested on the bench beside me. "We'll get through this. Together."

His hand was warm, solid, anchoring. I laced my fingers through his, acknowledging what we'd both been dancing around for weeks now.

"Together," I echoed.

We sat like that until the trainer returned, our hands linked, something fundamental having shifted between us even as my ankle throbbed and my championship dreams hung in uncertain balance.
