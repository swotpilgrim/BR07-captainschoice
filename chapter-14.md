# Chapter 14: The Apology

Tuesday's practice was intense in the best way. The team moved with precision, set pieces executed flawlessly, communication sharp, everyone in sync. We were clicking.

Coach Bradley watched from the sideline. When he blew the whistle to end practice, he gathered us.

"That's the standard. That's the level of execution I want to see consistently. Well done."

High praise from Coach, who wasn't known for compliments.

The team dispersed toward the locker rooms. I grabbed my water bottle and started toward my changing area when I heard Garrett's voice.

"Morgan. Can you stay back for a minute?"

I turned to find him standing on the field, his practice jersey dark with sweat, expression unreadable. My stomach tightened instinctively. Private conversations with Garrett had historically not gone well.

"Sure," I said, trying to sound casual.

The rest of the team filed off the field, Connor shooting me a questioning look that I answered with a small shrug. Within minutes, the field was empty except for the two of us and the late afternoon sun casting long shadows across the grass.

Garrett stood about ten feet away, and for a long moment he just looked at the ground, seeming to gather his thoughts. When he finally spoke, his voice was quiet but clear.

"I owe you an apology."

Of all the things I'd expected him to say, that wasn't one of them.

"For how I treated you when you first joined the team," he continued, still not quite meeting my eyes. "For the resistance and the hostility and making you feel like you had to prove yourself twice as hard as anyone else just to be accepted."

I stood very still, afraid that if I moved or spoke, he'd stop talking and I'd never hear whatever he was working so hard to say.

"When Coach announced the co-ed innovation and you won the tryout, I..." He paused, seeming to choose his words carefully. "I told myself it was about protecting the team. That your presence would be a distraction, that the media attention would overshadow our championship goals, that it would disrupt the chemistry we'd built."

He finally looked up, met my eyes.

"But that wasn't the real reason I opposed you. The truth is, I was scared."

The admission hung in the air between us.

"Scared?" I echoed.

"Scared that I'd lose control of the one thing I thought I could control—this team, this season, my shot at a scholarship." He ran a hand through his hair, a gesture I'd come to recognize as unconscious vulnerability. "You were this variable I couldn't predict or manage. I didn't know how good you'd actually be, how the team would react, how it would change our dynamics. And I needed everything to be perfect this season. I needed..."

He trailed off, frustration clear on his face.

"You needed certainty," I said quietly. "In a situation where your entire future was on the line."

"Yeah. And you represented uncertainty. So I decided you were a problem before ever giving you a fair chance." His jaw tightened. "That was wrong. You didn't deserve that."

The apology settled over me, unexpected and weighty.

"You've made this team better," Garrett continued. "Your set piece contributions have won us games. Your tactical insights have improved our play. And you've handled all the resistance—my resistance especially—with more professionalism and grace than I managed when things got hard."

"Garrett—"

"Let me finish." He took a breath. "My behavior toward you was unfair. It was based on my own insecurity and fear of losing control, not on any legitimate concern about your ability or your place on this team. I made your experience harder than it needed to be, and I'm sorry for that."

The sincerity in his voice, the obvious difficulty this apology cost him, made my throat tight.

"I understood," I said. "Even when your behavior hurt, I understood the pressure you were under. The scholarship stakes, the family expectations, the weight of being captain. I didn't take it personally—"

"You should have," Garrett interrupted. "It was personal, even if I told myself it wasn't. I treated you differently than I would have treated any male player joining the team. I dismissed your tactical input because you were new and because you were—" He stopped himself.

"Because I was a girl," I finished.

"I want to say it wasn't about that. But honestly? I think it was, at least partly. Not in some conscious sexist way, but in this underlying assumption that you couldn't possibly see the field as well as I did, that your insights weren't as valuable, that I knew better by default." He met my eyes. "That was wrong. And I'm sorry."

The full acknowledgment—not just of his initial resistance but of the gendered assumptions underlying it—meant more than I could articulate.

"Thank you," I said. "For saying that. For being honest about all of it."

"You deserved better from me as your captain."

"We were both under a lot of pressure. You were protecting what you thought you needed to protect."

"That doesn't excuse how I treated you."

"No," I agreed. "But it explains it. And I appreciate you taking the time to actually apologize instead of just letting things be awkward between us forever."

A ghost of a smile crossed Garrett's face. "That would have been the easier option."

"Probably."

We stood there in the fading light, and something fundamental had shifted. The barrier that had existed between us since my first day on the team—built from his resistance and my determination to overcome it—had dissolved.

"Can we start over?" I asked. "As actual teammates instead of whatever complicated thing we've been doing?"

"I'd like that." Garrett extended his hand. "Hi. I'm Garrett Hayes, captain of the soccer team. I'm stubborn, I have control issues, and I take way too much responsibility for things I can't actually control."

I took his hand, shaking it formally. "Riley Morgan, set piece specialist. I'm competitive, I have trust issues thanks to years of people underestimating me, and I take criticism way more personally than I pretend to."

"Sounds like we're both works in progress."

"Sounds like it."

We held the handshake a beat longer than strictly necessary, and I felt the significance of the moment. This wasn't just conflict resolution. It was two people choosing to see each other clearly—flaws and pressures and all—and deciding to move forward together.

When we finally let go and headed off the field together, walking side by side toward the athletics complex, it felt different from every other time we'd shared space. Less fraught, more comfortable. Like teammates. Like maybe even friends.

"For what it's worth," I said as we reached the building, "you're a good captain. Even when you were being impossible to me personally, I could see that your teammates trusted you and followed your lead. That's not nothing."

"Thanks." He paused at the door. "And for what it's worth, you're one of the most skilled set piece specialists I've ever played with. Your technical execution is elite, and your tactical mind is sharp. We're lucky to have you."

The compliment, coming from Garrett Hayes who'd spent weeks refusing to acknowledge my contributions, felt like a victory.

"See you tomorrow," I said.

"See you tomorrow."

I headed to my changing area with a smile I couldn't quite suppress. When I emerged and started walking back to my dorm, I found myself replaying the conversation. The vulnerability it must have taken for Garrett to make that apology. The honesty about his fears and his mistakes. The acknowledgment that gender had played a role in his resistance, even if he hadn't wanted to admit it.

It felt like closure. Like we'd finally cleared the air and could move forward without all the complicated baggage weighing down every interaction.

Kate was at her desk when I walked into our room, but she took one look at my face and immediately closed her laptop.

"What happened? You look... I don't know. Different."

"Garrett apologized."

"What?" Kate's eyebrows shot up. "Like, actually apologized? Not some half-assed 'sorry if you were offended' thing?"

"Actually apologized. Admitted he was wrong, explained his fears, acknowledged he treated me unfairly, even admitted gender played a role in how he dismissed my input." I sat on my bed, still processing. "It was... genuine."

"How do you feel about it?"

I thought about the question honestly. "Relieved. Validated. Like maybe all the work I put into proving myself actually mattered to someone who spent so long refusing to see it."

"Did you forgive him?"

"I accepted his apology. We agreed to start over as actual teammates."

Kate studied my face. "You're happy about this."

"I am. Is that weird?"

"Not at all. You've been fighting so hard for so long—against the resistance, against the skepticism, against Garrett's specific brand of obstruction. Having him finally acknowledge you and your skills, having him take responsibility for making it harder than it needed to be..." She smiled. "That's not weird to be happy about. That's called winning."

She was right. This felt like winning. Not the scoreboard kind of victory, but the harder, more meaningful kind—earning respect from someone who'd started out determined not to give it.

That night, lying in bed, I thought about Garrett's words on the empty field. His admission that he'd been scared, that his resistance had been unfair.

It took courage to apologize like that. To be that honest about fears and failures.

And it took something I hadn't expected from Garrett Hayes: humility.

Maybe we really could start over. Maybe this new foundation—built on mutual respect—could support a genuine partnership instead of a constant battle.

The thought made me smile.

Tomorrow we'd go back to practice, back to the normal rhythm. But it would be different now. Better.

Because finally, we were actually on the same team.
