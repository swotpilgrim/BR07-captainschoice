# Chapter 5: First Practice

I arrived at the athletics complex fifteen minutes early, my practice bag slung over one shoulder and my stomach doing gymnastics routines. The boys' team was already gathering near the field entrance, some stretching, others tossing balls back and forth.

Coach Bradley spotted me and waved me over to a side door. "Morgan. Good, you're early. Let's get you sorted with your practice gear."

He led me into the athletics complex through an entrance I'd never used before. The boys' locker room was down one hallway—I could hear voices and laughter echoing from inside—but Coach steered me to a smaller corridor that branched off to the side.

"This is a converted coach's office," he said, unlocking a door. "You'll change here to maintain appropriate boundaries. It's not ideal, but it's the best solution we've got for now."

The room was small but functional—a bench, some hooks on the wall, a mirror, and a narrow locker. Private, which I appreciated, but also physically separate from the rest of the team. A visual reminder that I wasn't quite one of them, not really.

"Your practice gear is in the locker," Coach continued. "Two sets of practice jerseys, shorts, and warm-ups. Your number is 10, same as you wore on the girls' team. Thought you might want to keep it."

"Thank you, sir. I appreciate that."

"Practice starts at three-thirty sharp. Don't be late." He paused at the door. "And Morgan? I meant what I said at tryouts. You earned this position. Hold yourself to the same standard you'd expect from any teammate, and you'll be fine."

After he left, I opened the locker and found the practice gear neatly folded inside. Navy blue jerseys with white trim, "OAKMONT" across the chest and "MORGAN" across the back. Number 10 in crisp white numbers.

I changed quickly, pulling on the practice jersey and trying not to think about how it felt both right and terrifying. This was really happening. I was really doing this.

At three twenty-five, I emerged from my makeshift changing room and headed to the field. The full team was assembled now—about twenty players in matching practice gear, all significantly taller than me. I was five-foot-seven, which wasn't short, but most of these guys had at least three or four inches on me.

Coach Bradley blew his whistle. "Bring it in!"

The team jogged over, forming a loose circle around Coach. I found a spot on the edge, hyperaware of the players on either side of me. Connor caught my eye and gave me a small nod. On my other side, a defender I didn't know yet kept his expression carefully neutral.

"Most of you met Riley Morgan at tryouts Thursday," Coach said. "She's officially joined the team as our set piece specialist. Morgan, these are your teammates. Introduce yourselves during warmups." He consulted his clipboard. "Standard warmup routine to start. Partner up for dynamic stretches."

The team broke apart immediately, players gravitating toward their usual partners. I stood there for a beat, unsure whether to wait for someone to approach me or to approach someone else.

Connor solved the problem by walking over with an easy grin. "Hey, Riley. Want to partner up?"

"Yeah, thanks."

We found a spot on the field and started the warmup routine—high knees, butt kicks, lateral shuffles. Connor kept up a steady stream of friendly chatter that helped ease some of my tension.

"So you were on the girls' varsity team, right? I saw you play once last year. You had that game-winning goal against Riverside."

"You saw that?" I was genuinely surprised.

"My girlfriend plays on the team. Well, played—she graduated last year. I used to watch their games sometimes." He grinned. "That goal was nice. Took it from like twenty-five yards out."

"Twenty-two, actually. But thanks."

"See, you're already making me look bad with the specifics." He laughed. "This is going to be fun."

We rotated through the stretches. Across the field, I noticed Garrett partnered with a stocky defender, going through the same routine. He hadn't looked at me once since I'd arrived. Deliberate avoidance, not accidental.

After warmups, Coach split us into groups for passing drills. "Morgan, you're with Group B."

Group B turned out to be me, Connor, Jordan the goalkeeper, and three other players. We formed a circle, working on one-touch and two-touch combinations.

"Riley Morgan," I said. "Good to meet you all."

"Jordan Blake," the goalkeeper said. He was tall and lean with an analytical gaze. "Saw you at tryouts. Nice technique."

The other three offered names—Ben, Marcus, and Tyler—with varying degrees of friendliness.

We worked through the drill, and I focused on keeping my touch clean and accurate. One-touch passes required good technique and awareness.

"Good weight on that pass, Morgan," Jordan called after I sent the ball to Connor with perfect pace.

After twenty minutes of passing drills, Coach called for set piece practice. My specialty. My stomach tightened with fresh nerves.

"Morgan, you're up," Coach said. "Let's see you work with the actual team dynamics. Show us how you read situations and place your kicks."

The team assembled in and around the penalty box for a corner kick drill. I grabbed a ball and jogged to the right corner, trying to channel all those hours of practice into muscle memory.

Garrett positioned himself at the top of the box—as captain, he'd be calling where players lined up during games. His instructions were clipped and efficient, placing forwards near post and far post, midfielder trailing for any clearances.

I surveyed the setup, then placed the ball in the corner arc. Measured my approach. Blocked out everything except the ball and the target.

My first kick curved in beautifully, finding Connor at the near post exactly where he needed it. He headed it toward goal—would have scored in a game situation.

"Again," Garrett called, his voice flat. "Far post this time."

I repositioned, adjusted my angle, and delivered the next kick with the same precision. Ben, positioned at the far post, got his head to it cleanly.

"One more," Garrett said. "Drive it low, hard pace."

I switched up my technique, striking the ball with more power and less height. It drove into the box at shin level, harder to handle, the kind of ball that created chaos in defensive situations. Tyler got a touch on it that would have deflected past any keeper.

Three corner kicks, three successful placements. Exactly what I needed to demonstrate.

Jordan, standing in goal watching the whole sequence, jogged forward slightly. "Your placement is excellent, Morgan. Really clean technique. Better than Thompson who graduated last year."

That was high praise. Thompson had been their set piece specialist, and I'd watched film of him. He was good.

"Thanks, Jordan. I appreciate that."

I glanced at Garrett, waiting for some acknowledgment or further instruction. He stood with his arms crossed, jaw tight, expression unreadable.

"Drill complete," he said after a long pause. "Move to free kick setup."

No compliment. No acknowledgment at all that I'd just placed three perfect corner kicks. Just immediate movement to the next thing.

Connor caught my eye and gave me a subtle eye roll that said he'd noticed Garrett's coldness too. It helped, slightly.

The rest of practice followed a similar pattern. I executed drills cleanly, received compliments or acknowledgment from some teammates like Jordan and Connor, and got complete silence from Garrett and several others. Derek Palmer, the defender I'd noticed watching me with hard eyes at tryouts, made a point of never passing to me during possession drills, even when I was clearly open.

By the time Coach called practice to an end, I was exhausted—not from the physical work, but from the mental energy of constantly proving myself, reading the social dynamics, staying focused despite the resistance.

"Good work today," Coach Bradley called. "Morgan, solid first practice. Keep that up." He consulted his clipboard. "Game Saturday against Worthington Academy. Full roster will suit up."

My first game. Four days away.

As the team dispersed toward the locker rooms, Connor fell into step beside me. "Hey, you did great. Seriously."

"Thanks. It felt... intense."

"Some of the guys are being weird about it," he admitted. "But you proved you belong today. Anyone paying attention could see that."

"Garrett doesn't seem to be paying attention."

Connor glanced over his shoulder at where Garrett was talking to Derek and a few other players. "Garrett's got a lot on his mind. Scholarship pressure, championship goals, the weight of being captain. He'll come around once he sees how you actually help the team."

I wasn't so sure about that, but I appreciated Connor's optimism.

"Listen," Connor continued, "a few of us are grabbing dinner in the dining hall around six if you want to join. Jordan, Ben, couple others. Might help with the whole team integration thing."

The invitation caught me off guard. "Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that. Thanks."

"Cool. See you then."

I headed back to my converted office to change, my legs heavy with exhaustion but my mind still racing. First practice complete. I'd executed well, demonstrated my skill clearly.

But I'd also faced Garrett's coldness, Derek's hostility, and the general wariness of a team unsure what to make of me.

Back in my dorm room, Kate looked up expectantly. "How was it?"

I dropped my bag and flopped onto my bed. "Mixed. I played well. Some of the guys were welcoming. Others..."

"Let me guess. The captain?"

"Garrett barely looked at me. Didn't acknowledge a single one of my kicks."

"What a jerk."

"Connor said he'll come around." I stared at the ceiling. "But I'm not holding my breath."

"You're there because you earned it, not because you need his approval."

"I know." I sat up, reaching for my shower caddy. "Connor invited me to dinner with some of the team later."

"That's great! See, you're already making allies."

I was going to need them with a captain who'd rather I didn't exist.

But I'd known it would be hard. First practice was just the beginning.

I had a game Saturday. Four days to prove I belonged.
