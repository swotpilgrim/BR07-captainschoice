# Chapter 4: Captain's Objection

News traveled fast at Oakmont. By Friday morning, everyone seemed to know I'd made the boys' varsity team. I got stares in the dining hall, whispered conversations that stopped when I walked past, and three different people I barely knew offering congratulations in the hallway between classes.

Alex found me at lunch and gave me a quick hug that felt both supportive and bittersweet. "You're still coming to our practice today, right? Until you officially start with the boys' team?"

"Yeah, of course. Monday's my first practice with them."

"Good. We'll give you a proper send-off." She smiled, but it didn't quite reach her eyes. "And Riley? Kick some ass over there. Show them what we're made of."

That evening, I returned to our dorm room after girls' soccer practice to find Kate sitting cross-legged on her bed with her laptop, but her attention was clearly on her phone. She looked up when I walked in, and something in her expression made me pause.

"What?" I asked, dropping my practice bag and grabbing my towel. "Why are you looking at me like that?"

"Looking at you like what?"

"Like you have information you're not sure you should share."

Kate bit her lip, considering. "Okay, so you know how Jake is on JV soccer?"

Jake was Kate's boyfriend, a junior who played midfield on the junior varsity team. They'd been dating since last spring. "Yeah?"

"He was at the athletics complex yesterday. After your tryout." Kate set her phone down. "He overheard something."

I sat down on my own bed, still holding my towel. "What did he overhear?"

"The varsity captain—Garrett Hayes—requested a meeting with Coach Bradley. Right after Coach announced you'd won the position."

I felt something tighten in my chest. I'd seen Garrett's face at the tryout, the way he'd stood with his arms crossed and refused to welcome me. Of course he'd gone to the coach.

"And?" I prompted when Kate hesitated.

"Jake was in the equipment room, grabbing balls for JV practice. The coach's office is right next to it, and apparently the walls are thin. He didn't mean to eavesdrop, but—"

"Kate. What did Garrett say?"

She exhaled. "That your addition to the team is a publicity stunt. That the administration is using the team to make Oakmont look progressive, and it's going to overshadow what should be their championship season. That media attention on the 'girl kicker' will distract from the actual soccer."

Each word landed like a small punch. I'd known there would be resistance, had prepared myself for it, but hearing it laid out so baldly still stung.

"What did Coach Bradley say?"

"According to Jake, Coach shut it down pretty quickly. Said you earned the position through demonstrated skill, same as every other player on the roster. That if Garrett had a problem with the decision, he could take it up with the headmaster, but Coach stood by his evaluation."

I processed this, staring at the carpet between my feet. Part of me was furious—how dare Garrett assume I was a token hire without even seeing me play beyond the tryout? But another part, the part that understood competitive pressure and high stakes, recognized where his objection came from.

"Did Jake hear anything else?"

"Garrett mentioned something about scouts and recruitment. That he needs a standout senior season to secure a scholarship, and he can't afford distractions or complications." Kate's voice was gentle. "Riley, I'm sorry. I wasn't sure if I should tell you, but I thought you'd want to know what you're walking into."

"No, you were right to tell me." I stood, grabbing my shower caddy. "I'd rather know than be blindsided."

"Are you okay?"

"Yeah. I'm fine."

I wasn't fine, exactly, but I needed to think, and I thought better in the shower. The hot water helped, even if my mind kept cycling through what Kate had told me.

Publicity stunt. Distraction. Those were the words Garrett had used.

Back in the room, I towel-dried my hair and pulled out my laptop. If I was going to be dealing with Garrett Hayes as team captain, I should at least know who he was beyond the number 7 jersey and crossed arms.

It didn't take long to find information. Oakmont's athletics website had a full roster with player profiles. Garrett Hayes, senior, captain since junior year. Center midfielder. Impressive stats from last season—assists, tackles, games started. Named to the all-conference team.

A quick search of his name brought up a few local newspaper articles from last year's championship run. In the photos, he looked intense, focused, every inch the leader. One article mentioned his older brother, Marcus Hayes, who'd captained Oakmont's team three years ago and went on to play Division I at a respectable program.

Legacy student. Following in his brother's footsteps. Scholarship dependent on a strong senior season.

No wonder he saw me as a threat.

I clicked to Oakmont's student newspaper archive and found a feature article from last spring. "Hayes Leads Soccer to Regional Championships." The piece included an interview where Garrett talked about the pressure of living up to his brother's legacy and his goal of leading the team to a state title his senior year.

"This program means everything to me," he'd said. "It's not just about winning games. It's about proving something—to the scouts, to the school, to myself."

I closed my laptop and leaned back against my headboard. Kate glanced over from her desk where she'd been pretending to do homework.

"Learn anything useful?"

"That he has a lot riding on this season," I said. "And that he sees me as a variable he can't control."

"Are you worried?"

I thought about it honestly. Was I worried? Yes. Joining a team where the captain actively opposed my presence wasn't ideal. But giving up wasn't an option.

"I knew there'd be resistance," I said finally. "I just thought it would be less... personal. More of a general skepticism I could prove wrong over time."

"Maybe you still can. Prove him wrong, I mean."

"That's the plan." I grabbed my history textbook, determined to focus on something productive. "I can't control what Garrett thinks about why I'm on the team. I can only control how I play."

My dad's voice again. You control what you can control.

Kate was quiet for a moment, then said, "For what it's worth, Jake said some of the guys seem fine with it. Excited, even. He heard a couple of them talking about how your corner kick at tryouts was legitimately perfect."

That helped, slightly. "Which guys?"

"Connor Mitchell was one. And the goalkeeper—Jordan something?"

Connor, who'd welcomed me with an actual smile. Jordan, who'd complimented my shot. Not everyone was against this.

That night, lying in bed, I thought about Monday's first practice. About showing up to a team where the captain had openly called my position a publicity stunt. About trying to prove myself to players who might already be convinced I didn't belong.

I'd faced doubt before. Youth soccer when I was the only girl on a boys' travel team. The whispers that I only made Oakmont's varsity team as a freshman because the coach felt sorry for me. The college showcase where a scout had asked if I'd considered managing instead of playing.

Every time, I'd responded the same way: by being undeniably good. By making plays that couldn't be dismissed or explained away. By forcing people to respect my skill even if they didn't want to.

Garrett Hayes was just another obstacle. A bigger one, maybe, because he was the captain and his opinion influenced the team. But still just an obstacle.

I rolled over, staring at the window. The boys' practice field lights were off tonight—no late practice on Friday. Come Monday, I'd be out there in an official capacity. Part of the team, whether Garrett liked it or not.

The thought sent a mix of anxiety and determination through my chest. Coach Bradley believed in my ability. Connor and Jordan seemed open-minded. And I had my own skill and preparation to rely on.

"Riley?" Kate's voice came through the darkness. "You still awake?"

"Yeah."

"You're going to be great. You know that, right?"

I smiled despite everything. "Thanks, Kate."

"I'm serious. Garrett Hayes doesn't know what's about to hit him."

I hoped she was right.

The weekend passed in a blur of homework, a girls' soccer game Saturday that we won easily, and my own extra practice sessions on the empty fields Sunday afternoon. I worked on corner kicks from both sides until my plant leg ached. Practiced free kicks with different curves and trajectories. Took penalty shots until I could do it with my eyes closed.

Sunday night, I laid out my practice clothes for Monday. Black shorts, the compression tank top I preferred, my good cleats cleaned and ready. Coach had said I'd get fitted for official practice gear, but I wanted to look professional from day one.

Kate watched me organize everything with amusement. "You know it's just practice, right? Not the World Cup?"

"First impressions matter."

"You already made your first impression at tryouts. You know, when you assisted on a goal and won the position?"

"That was different. That was proving I could kick. Monday is proving I can be part of the team."

Kate came over and put her hands on my shoulders, making me look at her. "You're going to do great. And if anyone gives you trouble, you've got an entire girls' soccer team ready to back you up."

"Thanks." I meant it. "I'm glad you're my roommate."

"Obviously. Who else would put up with your neurotic pre-practice preparation?"

I threw a sock at her, and she laughed, and for a moment everything felt normal. Just two friends in their dorm room, teasing each other before bed.

But as I lay in the dark later, I couldn't quite shake the nervousness coiling in my stomach. Tomorrow I'd walk into the boys' varsity locker area for the first time as an actual team member. I'd practice with players who might resent my presence. I'd take instruction from a captain who'd called me a distraction.

My phone buzzed with a text. My dad: "Good luck tomorrow, kiddo. Remember—trust your preparation and block out the noise. You've got this."

I texted back: "Thanks, Dad. Love you."

His response came immediately: "Love you too. Make 'em respect the game."

I set my phone down and closed my eyes, visualizing tomorrow's practice. Warmup drills executed perfectly. Corner kicks placed exactly where they needed to go. Professional demeanor that gave no one any excuse to dismiss me.

Garrett Hayes thought I was a publicity stunt? A distraction?

I'd show him exactly what kind of distraction I could be—the kind that won games.
