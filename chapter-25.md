# Chapter 25: Championship Eve

The team meeting room felt different the day before championship. Same space we'd gathered in dozens of times throughout the season, but charged now with anticipation and nervous energy. Tomorrow would determine everything—win or lose, this was the culmination of months of work.

Coach Bradley stood at the front, tactical board behind him showing Bridgewater Academy's defensive formation. We'd studied their game film until we could predict their plays, identified their weaknesses, designed our strategy to exploit every gap.

Now it was just about execution.

"Tomorrow isn't just another game," Coach said, his voice carrying the weight of experience and expectation. "Tomorrow is what you've earned through discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. Bridgewater is a strong team, but so are you. Stronger, because you've learned to trust each other this season."

His eyes swept across all of us—starters and reserves, seniors and underclassmen, every player who'd contributed to getting us here.

"You've embraced change when it would have been easier to resist it. You've adapted your strategies to maximize everyone's strengths. You've become a team in the truest sense—not just individuals playing the same sport, but a unit that makes each other better."

I felt the words land, felt the truth of them. This team had become something special this season. Not just because we'd won games, but because we'd genuinely grown together.

"Get good rest tonight," Coach continued. "Hydrate, eat well, visualize success. Tomorrow, leave everything on that field. Play for each other, trust your training, and show Bridgewater why Oakmont deserves this championship."

We broke from the meeting buzzing with energy and determination. Tomorrow couldn't come fast enough.

Garrett asked for the room before we dispersed.

"Coach is right—tomorrow is what we've earned," he said, standing at the front in his captain role. "But I want to take a minute to acknowledge how we got here."

He proceeded to thank each player by name, citing specific contributions. When he got to me, our eyes met across the room.

"Riley showed extraordinary courage joining this team, knowing she'd face scrutiny and skepticism. She proved herself through skill and determination, game after game. Her set piece contributions have been crucial to our success, but more than that, her presence taught us that tradition doesn't mean refusing to evolve. That being the best team means being open to the best players, period."

The room erupted in agreement—Connor's loud "Hell yeah!", Jordan's nod of respect, even Derek's grudging smile.

"Tomorrow, we play for each other," Garrett continued. "Every player on this team matters. Every contribution counts. We win or lose together."

The team responded with unified determination, voices overlapping with promises to leave everything on the field, to fight for each other, to bring home the championship.

As we filed out, Garrett caught my eye and gave a small nod that felt like a private acknowledgment. Tomorrow, we'd play together one more time. Then everyone could know about us.

The school organized a pep rally that evening in the main gymnasium. The entire student body showed up, packing the bleachers with navy and gold Oakmont colors, handmade signs and painted faces creating an atmosphere of genuine school pride.

I stood with my team at center court, wearing my jersey with "MORGAN 10" on the back, and felt the weight of representing something larger than myself. Not just the team, but everyone who'd supported the co-ed innovation, everyone who believed female athletes deserved equal opportunities.

The pressure should have been crushing. Instead, standing beside my teammates with the school's support echoing around us, I felt ready.

"Give it up for your varsity soccer team!" the student council president shouted, and the gym exploded with noise.

Garrett gave a brief speech as captain about gratitude for support and determination to win. Short, powerful, exactly what the moment needed. Then Coach spoke, the athletic director, finally the headmaster who'd approved the co-ed innovation in the first place.

"Regardless of tomorrow's outcome, this team has already made history," the headmaster said. "They've shown that excellence knows no gender, that tradition can evolve without losing its meaning, that being the best means embracing the best."

The crowd roared approval, and I felt Kate grab my hand and squeeze. Looking out at the sea of supportive faces—students who'd watched my journey this season, teachers who'd encouraged me, even some skeptical alumni who'd been won over by results—I realized something profound.

I'd already succeeded.

Win or lose tomorrow, I'd proven what I set out to prove. I belonged on this team. Female athletes could compete at the highest levels. The co-ed innovation worked because it was based on merit and skill, not politics or quotas.

Tomorrow's game would determine our championship status. But it wouldn't determine my worth or validate my accomplishments.

I'd already done that myself.

After the rally, as the team headed to the dining hall for the pre-game meal, Alex found me in the hallway.

"Got a minute?" she asked.

We stepped into an empty classroom, away from the crowd.

"I wanted to tell you something before tomorrow," Alex said. "Two juniors from our girls' team are trying out for the boys' team next season. And the headmaster approved adding female positions to the boys' baseball and lacrosse teams too."

My throat went tight. "Really?"

"Really. Because you proved it could work. Because you showed that skill and dedication matter more than outdated assumptions about who can play where." Alex smiled. "You opened doors, Riley. Not just for yourself, but for everyone coming after you."

"I just wanted to play soccer," I managed.

"You did. And in doing so, you changed the entire athletic program." She hugged me quickly. "Win or lose tomorrow, you've already won something bigger."

The team dinner was boisterous, full of the particular energy that comes before major competitions. Connor told increasingly ridiculous stories that had everyone laughing. Jordan remained calm and analytical, discussing strategy with quiet confidence. Derek actually participated in team bonding without his usual edge.

I sat between Garrett and Connor, accepted into team dynamics without question or caveat. Just another player contributing to pre-game preparation.

But when Garrett's hand briefly touched mine under the table—hidden from view but deliberately seeking contact—I was reminded that I was also something more. Something private and precious that tomorrow would finally become public.

After dinner, as everyone dispersed to their dorms for mandatory rest before tomorrow's game, Garrett found me on the path between buildings.

"Walk with me?" he asked quietly.

We took the long route to my dorm, extending the minutes we could be alone together.

"Nervous about tomorrow?" Garrett asked.

"Surprisingly, no. More... ready? Like everything this season has been building toward this moment."

"It has been." We'd reached a secluded spot near the library, and Garrett stopped walking. "Riley, I want you to know that regardless of what happens tomorrow, I'm proud of you. Proud to be your teammate, proud to be your..." he hesitated.

"Boyfriend?" I supplied with a small smile.

"Yeah. That." He smiled back. "Tomorrow, after we win championship, everyone gets to know. No more hiding, no more pretending we're just teammates."

"You're that confident we'll win?"

"With you on the field? Absolutely." His hand found mine in the darkness. "But even if we don't, even if everything goes wrong tomorrow, I'll still feel the same way about you. The championship doesn't define us."

"No," I agreed. "But it would be really nice to win it."

"It really would."

We stood together in the November cold, hands linked, both of us visualizing tomorrow's game. The stakes, the pressure, the opportunity.

"Thank you," I said quietly.

"For what?"

"For eventually giving me a chance when you could have made my life impossible. For apologizing when you realized you were wrong. For becoming a partner instead of an obstacle. For caring about me as a person, not just a player."

Garrett pulled me into a hug, careful and warm despite the cold night air. "Thank you for refusing to quit when I was being an ass. For proving yourself even when you shouldn't have had to. For teaching me what real strength looks like. For being you."

We held each other until the cold became too much, then reluctantly separated.

"Get some sleep," Garrett said. "Big day tomorrow."

"You too, captain."

He walked me the rest of the way to my dorm, and we parted with appropriate distance in case anyone was watching. But the warmth of his hug stayed with me as I climbed the stairs to my room.

Kate was already in bed, but she sat up when I entered. "How are you feeling?"

"Good. Really good, actually." I started getting ready for bed, moving through my nighttime routine. "Tomorrow we're going to win championship."

"That's the spirit."

"And then Garrett and I can stop hiding our relationship."

"Even better." Kate grinned. "Though for the record, you two haven't been that subtle. Pretty sure half the team knows."

"Suspects, maybe. But knowing is different."

"Fair point."

I climbed into bed, elevating my ankle out of habit even though it had held up well through practice all week. Tomorrow it would need to hold up through the most important game of my life.

But lying there in the darkness, listening to Kate's breathing even out into sleep, I wasn't worried about my ankle or the game or anything beyond this moment of peace before everything changed.

I'd worked my entire life for tomorrow. Trained since I was six years old, fought through every doubt and obstacle, refused to accept limitations other people tried to place on me.

Tomorrow, all of that work culminated in one game.

Win or lose, I'd proven I belonged.

Win or lose, I'd opened doors for others.

Win or lose, I'd found Garrett and a partnership that transcended soccer.

But I fully intended to win.

For the team. For Coach Bradley who'd believed in me. For the girls watching who needed to see that barriers could be broken.

And for myself. Because I'd earned this moment, and I was going to seize it with everything I had.

Tomorrow was championship day.

I fell asleep smiling, dreaming of field lights and perfect kicks and holding hands with Garrett where everyone could see.

Tomorrow.
