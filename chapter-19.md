# Chapter 19: Growing Feelings

Six games left in the season. Six games between us and a potential championship.

Six games where I couldn't stop being aware of Garrett Hayes in ways that had nothing to do with soccer.

"Morgan, you're drifting," Coach Bradley called during Tuesday's practice. "Focus on your positioning."

I'd been watching Garrett organize the defensive line instead of concentrating on my drill. Heat crept up my neck as I jogged back into position.

"You okay?" Connor asked quietly as we prepared for the kick.

"Fine. Just thinking."

"Uh-huh." His tone suggested he knew exactly what—or who—I'd been thinking about.

I delivered the corner kick precisely to Connor's head, and he redirected it into the goal with practiced ease. We'd run this play so many times it was muscle memory now. But as I jogged back to reset, my eyes found Garrett anyway, and I caught him watching me with an expression that made my stomach flip.

We looked away simultaneously, both of us pretending we hadn't just been staring at each other.

This was getting ridiculous.

"We need to talk," Kate announced that evening, shutting our door firmly.

I looked up from my calculus homework. "About what?"

"About you and Garrett barely able to look at each other without blushing. About how you've been 'studying together' four nights a week." She used air quotes. "Riley, it's getting obvious."

"We are studying together."

"And the intense longing looks across the dining hall?"

I closed my textbook. "Kate—"

"Do you have feelings for him? Real, actual feelings beyond 'good teammate' feelings?"

The direct question deserved a direct answer. "Yes."

"Does he have feelings for you?"

I thought about Garrett sharing his championship failure story. About falling asleep on his shoulder on the bus. About the way our hands had brushed during film study last night and neither of us had pulled away. About a hundred small moments that added up to something I couldn't ignore anymore.

"I think so. Maybe. We haven't talked about it."

Kate sat on her bed facing me, her expression serious now. "Why not?"

"Because what if I'm wrong? What if talking about it makes things weird and ruins the partnership we've built?" I pulled my knees to my chest. "We have six crucial games left. The team needs us focused on soccer, not dealing with romantic drama."

"Or," Kate said gently, "you could be honest about how you feel and discover he feels the same way. And then you'd have six games to play together as partners who actually acknowledge they care about each other."

"It's not that simple."

"It could be."

I rested my chin on my knees. "What if people think I only got to stay on the team because I'm dating the captain? What if it diminishes everything I've accomplished?"

"You've been on the team for two months. You've proven yourself in game after game. Your stats speak for themselves." Kate's voice was firm. "Anyone who thinks your performance has anything to do with romance is deliberately ignoring reality."

"People ignore reality all the time when it comes to female athletes."

"Then screw them." Kate leaned forward. "Riley, you've spent your whole life proving yourself to people who questioned whether you belonged. At some point, you have to decide that you've already proven enough and just live your life."

The words hit harder than I expected. Because she was right—I'd been fighting for acceptance and validation for so long, I'd forgotten that I'd already earned it. The team respected me. Coach valued my contributions. Scouts were calling about recruitment.

I'd already proven I belonged.

"I'm scared," I admitted quietly.

"Of what?"

"Of wanting this. Of wanting him." I gestured helplessly. "I came here for soccer. For my future, for scholarships, for my career. Feelings for Garrett weren't part of the plan."

"The best things usually aren't planned," Kate said. "They just happen while you're focused on something else."

Thursday after practice, I heard voices from the equipment room—Connor and Garrett.

I should walk away, but I hesitated just outside the door.

"You're being an idiot," Connor was saying, his voice carrying that particular mix of exasperation and affection reserved for close friends. "Just tell her how you feel."

"It's not that simple." Garrett's voice, lower and more controlled than Connor's.

"Why not? You like her, she obviously likes you. You work great together on the field. You're already spending all your free time together. Just make it official."

"What if it goes wrong? What if dating screws up the team dynamic right when we need total focus for the championship push?"

My heart was pounding so hard I was sure they could hear it through the wall.

"Dude," Connor said, "the team dynamic is already affected. Everyone can see the way you two look at each other. Derek literally made a bet about how long before you admit you're into her."

"Derek what?"

"Relax, I told him to shut up. But my point is, it's already obvious. You're not hiding anything. You're just refusing to actually be happy about it."

There was a long pause. Then Garrett's voice, quieter now: "What if she came to Oakmont for soccer and scholarships, not to deal with romantic complications from her captain? What if I'm projecting what I want onto a situation she doesn't want?"

"Have you considered asking her?"

"And if I'm wrong? If I misread everything and she just sees me as a teammate?"

"Then you'll know," Connor said simply. "Better than wondering."

I backed away quietly before they could catch me eavesdropping, my mind racing.

Garrett had feelings for me. Real feelings he was scared to admit.

Just like I had feelings I was scared to admit.

We were both protecting something that might not need protecting anymore.

Friday evening, the team gathered for our traditional pre-game meal. I sat with Kate and Alex while we waited for the team table to fill.

Garrett arrived with Connor and Jordan. Without thinking, I watched him move through the dining hall—the quiet confidence, the genuine smile at something Connor said.

The way his eyes found mine across the room, and everything else faded.

We held the eye contact a beat too long. Long enough that Kate elbowed me and Alex made a knowing sound.

"Okay, what's happening there?" Alex asked.

I dragged my attention back to my food. "Nothing."

"That was not a 'nothing' look. That was a 'something very significant' look."

"Riley and Garrett have feelings for each other but they're both too stubborn to admit it," Kate supplied helpfully.

"I'm sitting right here," I protested.

Alex's expression shifted, becoming more serious. "Are you dating him?"

"No."

"But you want to?"

I hesitated, then nodded.

"Okay." Alex seemed to be processing this. "For what it's worth, I think he's good for you. You seem happier this season than I've ever seen you, even with all the pressure of being on the boys' team."

"You're not worried it diminishes what I've accomplished?" I asked carefully.

"Riley, you're assisting on goals and making crucial plays in games. You've earned legitimate respect from one of the toughest teams in our conference. If you also happen to have feelings for your captain, that's completely separate from your athletic merit." Alex smiled. "Plus, from what I've seen, Garrett's one of the good ones. He'd never disrespect your achievements."

The endorsement from Alex—who'd had her own complicated feelings about my move to the boys' team—meant more than she probably knew.

Later, as the team table filled, I found myself sitting near Garrett without consciously deciding to. It just happened naturally now.

Our hands brushed as we both reached for the water pitcher. Both of us pulled back, then laughed awkwardly.

"Sorry," Garrett said.

"No, I've got it," I said, pouring water for both of us without asking. A small gesture, domestic and familiar, that I'd somehow started doing automatically.

Garrett accepted his glass with a small smile that felt private despite the crowded table.

Across from us, Connor caught my eye and smirked knowingly. I looked away quickly, focusing very intently on my pasta.

"Tomorrow's game is crucial," Garrett said, addressing the whole table but somehow it felt like he was talking to me. "Kendrick's defensive formation is tight, but they leave gaps on corner kicks. We'll need to capitalize on set pieces."

"Riley's placement has been excellent," Jordan added, his goalkeeper's analytical perspective lending weight to the observation. "If we execute the plays we've been running, we'll find opportunities."

The conversation shifted to game strategy, and I contributed tactical observations that Garrett built on naturally. We'd developed a rhythm to this—the way I'd read defenses and he'd position players, the way his strategic vision and my kick execution complemented each other seamlessly.

It was partnership. Real partnership, built on mutual respect and trust.

And it was also something more that neither of us would say out loud.

After dinner, I headed back through the October darkness, leaves crunching underfoot. Halfway across the quad, I heard footsteps behind me.

"Riley, wait up."

Garrett jogged to catch up, falling into step beside me. We walked in silence.

"Big game tomorrow," I said eventually.

"Yeah."

The silence was charged, weighted with everything we weren't saying.

"Listen," Garrett started, then stopped. Ran his hand through his hair. "I wanted to—there's something I think we should—"

"Hayes! Morgan!"

Derek's voice carried across the quad, shattering the moment. He was heading toward the gym with two other players, waving at us. "Film session in ten minutes. Coach wants to review Kendrick's defensive formations one more time."

"Be right there," Garrett called back.

Derek and the others disappeared into the athletics building. Garrett and I stood there, whatever he'd been about to say hanging unfinished between us.

"You should get to film session," I said quietly.

"Come with me? You always catch things in the footage I miss."

So I did, following him to the film room where half the team was assembled. We sat together—not touching, carefully maintaining distance, but everyone could probably see the awareness between us anyway.

For ninety minutes, we analyzed Kendrick's defense. Professional, focused, exactly what we should be doing.

But I was aware of Garrett the whole time. The way he leaned forward when concentrating. How he turned to me specifically when discussing set pieces, trusting my tactical read.

The way our shoulders brushed and neither of us moved away.

This thing between us—this growing, undeniable thing—wasn't going away just because we refused to acknowledge it.

Eventually, we'd have to decide what to do about it.

But tonight, with a crucial game tomorrow, we both silently agreed to keep pretending we were just teammates.

Even though everyone, including us, knew better.
