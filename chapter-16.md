# Chapter 16: Midpoint Realization

The library was quieter than usual for a Thursday afternoon, most students outside enjoying the rare October warmth before winter settled in for good. I'd come here to finish my calculus problem set, not to think about soccer or the newspaper article Kate had shoved in front of me at breakfast with a knowing grin.

But there it was again, spread across the table in the study carrel three rows from mine. And there was Garrett Hayes, reading it.

I could see the headline from where I sat: "Oakmont Rises: Championship Dreams Alive as Team Clinbs to Second Place." The subheading made my stomach flip: "Historic Co-Ed Innovation Elevates Team Performance."

Garrett's head was bent over the paper, his dark hair falling forward slightly as he read. I'd been trying to concentrate on derivatives for the past fifteen minutes, but my eyes kept drifting back to him. He hadn't noticed me yet, too absorbed in whatever the article said.

I should leave. Let him read in peace.

Instead, I found myself standing, calculus forgotten, walking toward his carrel.

"Pretty sure you already know how the season's going," I said, keeping my voice light.

Garrett's head snapped up, and for half a second, something like guilt crossed his face before he smoothed it away. "Morgan. Didn't see you there."

"Mind if I sit?" I gestured to the empty chair across from him.

He hesitated, then nodded. "It's your school too."

I slid into the chair and glanced at the newspaper between us. The article had photos—our team celebrating after the Weston game, me mid-kick during a free kick, Garrett directing players during a corner. The caption under my photo read: "Riley Morgan, Oakmont's historic female kicker, has contributed crucial assists in four conference wins."

"They make it sound like we've already won the championship," I said.

"We're only second in the conference," Garrett agreed. "Still have six games to go. But..." He tapped the article. "Coach forwarded this to a few scouts he knows. The publicity is actually helping."

That surprised me. "I thought you were worried about the publicity."

Garrett's jaw tightened, and he met my eyes directly. "I was. I was wrong."

The admission hung between us in the quiet library. Around us, a few students typed on laptops, another flipped through a chemistry textbook, someone's printer hummed in the corner. Normal library sounds that suddenly felt very far away.

"The article talks about how the co-ed innovation brought in media attention," Garrett continued, his voice lower now. "More scouts at games. More coverage of Oakmont athletics overall. It's not overshadowing the team—it's elevating us."

"So your nightmare scenario didn't happen," I said carefully.

"No." He ran a hand through his hair, a gesture I'd seen him make a hundred times during film study when he was thinking through a complicated play. "What happened is you earned your spot, proved yourself in every game, and made us better. The media attention came because of your performance, not despite it."

My throat felt tight. "I didn't do it for media attention."

"I know." Garrett's gaze was steady, intense in a way that made something flutter in my chest. "You did it because you're good enough to play at this level and you refused to accept anything less than what you deserved."

The compliment shouldn't have affected me this much. I'd heard praise from Coach Bradley, from Connor, even from Jordan's analytical assessments. But hearing it from Garrett—the guy who'd fought hardest against my presence—felt different. Felt like it mattered more than it should.

"That must have taken courage I didn't appreciate at the time," Garrett said quietly. "Knowing you'd face scrutiny no matter how you performed. Knowing one mistake would be magnified, one success questioned. You showed up anyway."

I forced myself to keep my voice steady. "You're under the same pressure. Captain, senior year, scholarship on the line, family expectations. I read the part about your brother being captain here too."

Something flickered in Garrett's expression. "Yeah. Legacy and all that."

"Pressure," I said.

"Different kind than yours."

"Still pressure." I leaned forward slightly. "We're both representing something bigger than ourselves. You're trying to live up to your brother's captaincy and prove you belong here as more than just a legacy admission. I'm trying to prove female athletes can compete at this level."

Garrett was quiet for a long moment, his eyes searching mine like he was seeing something for the first time. "I never thought about it that way. About us both carrying weight like that."

"We all carry something," I said. "At least we're on the same team now."

"Yeah." His voice was rough. "We are."

The silence that fell between us wasn't uncomfortable, exactly, but it was charged with something I couldn't quite name. I became suddenly, acutely aware of how close we were sitting, the library table between us no longer feeling like much of a barrier.

I noticed things I'd been trying not to notice for weeks now. The way Garrett's eyes were more gray than blue, especially in the library's fluorescent lighting. The small scar above his left eyebrow—probably from a soccer injury, knowing him. The way his shoulders filled out his Oakmont Athletics hoodie, the same one half the team wore but somehow different on him.

The way he was looking at me now, with an intensity that had nothing to do with soccer tactics.

"Your support meant more than you know," I heard myself say, the words escaping before I could stop them. "Earning your respect felt like proof I truly belonged. Not just that I could kick accurately or read defenses. That I actually belonged on this team."

Garrett's expression shifted, something vulnerable breaking through his usual controlled captain's mask. "Riley—"

"Morgan! There you are!"

Kate's voice shattered the moment like a rock through glass. I jerked back in my chair as my roommate appeared at the end of the aisle, waving a Spanish textbook. "I've been looking everywhere for you. You were supposed to help me with subjunctive verbs, remember?"

I had absolutely no memory of promising that, but Kate's pointed look suggested she knew exactly what she was interrupting and had done it deliberately.

"Right," I managed, standing up too quickly. My chair scraped against the floor, drawing annoyed looks from nearby students. "Sorry, I lost track of time."

Garrett stood too, gathering the newspaper with careful, deliberate movements. "I should get going anyway. Study group in twenty minutes."

Our eyes met one more time, and in that brief moment, something passed between us. An acknowledgment. A question neither of us was ready to ask out loud.

Then Kate was hooking her arm through mine, chattering about Spanish verb conjugations, pulling me away from the study carrel and back toward reality.

I glanced back once. Garrett was still standing there, newspaper forgotten in his hands, watching me leave.

"You're welcome," Kate said the moment we were out of the library and crossing the quad toward our dorm.

"For what?"

"For saving you from doing something stupid like confessing your feelings in the middle of the library where anyone could overhear."

I stopped walking. "I don't—I wasn't—"

Kate turned to face me, hands on hips. "Riley. I've been your roommate for three years. I know your 'focused on soccer' face. That was not your soccer face."

Heat crept up my neck. "We were just talking about the newspaper article."

"Uh-huh. And the way you were looking at each other was definitely about journalism."

I resumed walking, faster now, but Kate kept pace easily. "Even if I did have feelings—which I'm not saying I do—it would be a terrible idea. I'm on his team. I came here to play soccer and earn a scholarship, not to deal with romantic complications."

"Feelings aren't exactly something you can schedule around your athletic goals," Kate pointed out.

"Maybe not. But I can choose not to act on them."

We'd reached our dorm, climbing the stairs to the third floor in silence. Only when we were safely inside our room with the door closed did Kate speak again.

"Would it really be so terrible?" she asked quietly. "If something did happen between you two?"

I sat on my bed, pulling my knees to my chest. Through our window, I could see the practice fields below, the girls' team running drills on one side, the boys' team on the other. Two worlds I'd been straddling all season.

"I don't know," I admitted. "I worked so hard to prove I earned my spot based on merit. What if people thought the only reason Coach Bradley lets me play is because the captain likes me? What if it diminishes everything I've accomplished?"

"Or," Kate said gently, "what if two people who respect each other and push each other to be better happen to also have feelings for each other? What if that's allowed?"

I rested my chin on my knees, watching Garrett lead the boys' team through a possession drill. Even from here, I could see his leadership, the way he commanded the field with presence and tactical intelligence.

"I noticed things today," I said quietly. "In the library. Things I've been trying not to notice."

"Like?"

"Like how he looks when he's thinking. The way he runs his hand through his hair. The scar above his eyebrow. The exact color of his eyes." I swallowed hard. "Kate, I think I'm in trouble."

My roommate sat beside me on the bed, bumping my shoulder with hers. "For what it's worth? I think he's noticing things about you too. The way he looked at you when you walked away? That wasn't 'good teammate' looking. That was something else entirely."

We sat together in silence, watching the practice fields below as afternoon shadows lengthened across the grass. Somewhere between tryouts and today, between hostility and partnership, between proving myself and earning respect, something had shifted.

I'd come to Oakmont to play soccer. To access better resources and coaching. To catch scouts' attention and secure my future.

I hadn't planned on Garrett Hayes.

But as I watched him below, directing his team with the same intensity he brought to everything, I had to admit the truth Kate already knew.

Somewhere between resenting his resistance and respecting his captaincy, between fighting for acceptance and finding partnership, I'd developed feelings I never intended to have.

And based on the way Garrett had looked at me in the library, the careful distance he'd been maintaining, the vulnerability in his voice when he'd admitted being wrong about me—

I wasn't the only one trying not to notice things I shouldn't.

The question was what either of us planned to do about it.
