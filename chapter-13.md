# Chapter 13: Mutual Respect

The play we'd designed in the hotel lobby worked perfectly.

Eighth minute, we earned a corner kick on the right. Garrett positioned Ben at the top of the box, exactly where we'd discussed. I delivered the kick with the curve and placement we'd planned.

Northfield's defenders collapsed toward the near post, leaving Ben unmarked. The ball cleared to him off a deflection, and Ben volleyed it cleanly into the upper corner. 1-0 Oakmont.

The celebration swept me up—Connor lifting me off my feet, Jordan high-fiving me, Ben pointing at me.

And Garrett, jogging past, caught my eye and nodded once. We did that. Together.

We won 3-0. I assisted on another goal in the second half, a free kick Connor headed home. The team played with confidence and cohesion, everything clicking.

Coach Bradley appeared in my doorway after. "Excellent game, Morgan. Both your set pieces led directly to goals. Elite-level contribution."

"Thanks, Coach."

The bus ride home had a completely different energy than the ride there. Where Friday's trip had been focused and slightly nervous, Sunday afternoon's return was pure celebration. Someone's phone was connected to the bus speakers playing music. Guys were singing along badly, recounting the game's best moments, riding the high of a convincing win.

I'd planned to sit with Connor and Jordan again, but when I boarded the bus, Connor waved apologetically and gestured to a girl sitting in his usual spot—his girlfriend, who'd driven to the game to watch.

"Sorry, Morgan! Sit anywhere!"

Jordan had already partnered with Ben. Most of the usual seats were claimed by established pairs or groups.

I scanned the bus, looking for an open spot, and found one about halfway back. Next to Garrett.

He glanced up as I approached, then moved his bag off the seat beside him. "Looking for a seat?"

"If you don't mind."

"Go ahead."

I slid in beside him, stowing my bag overhead. The bus pulled out of the parking lot, heading toward the highway for the three-hour trip home.

Around us, the team's celebration continued—loud and chaotic and joyful. But in our row, there was unexpected quiet. Not awkward exactly, just... calm. A bubble of stillness in the chaos.

Garrett had his headphones around his neck, his phone in his hand but the screen dark. Like he'd been sitting there just thinking before I sat down.

"Good game," he said after a few minutes.

"Thanks. You too. That through ball to Connor in the first half was perfect."

"He made the run. I just had to see it."

We lapsed back into silence. Out the window, Pennsylvania countryside rolled past. On the bus, someone was trying to start a team chant, and the result was more laughter than actual chanting.

"Can I ask you something?" Garrett said suddenly.

I looked at him. "Sure."

"How do you stay that calm? During set pieces, especially the high-pressure ones. You're ice cold. I've watched you—heart rate probably doesn't even spike."

The question surprised me. Not confrontational or challenging, just genuinely curious.

"My heart rate definitely spikes," I said. "I just don't let it show."

"How?"

I thought about how to explain something my dad had drilled into me for years. "My father taught me this philosophy: You can only control the execution, not the outcome. So I focus on what I can control—my approach, my technique, my read of the defense. Everything else is just noise."

Garrett absorbed this, his expression thoughtful. "What about the pressure? Everyone watching, the game on the line?"

"That's noise too. I mean, I feel it. I'm aware the moment matters. But I can't control whether other people are watching or what they expect. I can only control whether I place the ball where I intend to place it."

"That's..." He paused, searching for words. "That's a very disciplined way to think about it."

"It's the only way I can function. If I start thinking about all the variables I can't control—the wind, the referee, whether defenders read the play correctly—I'd freeze up."

Garrett was quiet for a long moment, staring out the window. "I wish I could think like that."

"You don't?"

"No. I think about all of it. Every variable, every possible outcome, everything that could go wrong." He ran a hand through his hair, a gesture that seemed unconsciously vulnerable. "As captain, I feel like I'm responsible for all of it. If we lose, it's because I didn't prepare enough or didn't position people correctly or didn't see something I should have seen."

I recognized the weight in his voice. "That's a lot of pressure to put on yourself."

"It's the job."

"Is it, though?" I shifted to face him more fully. "Leadership isn't about controlling every variable. It's about maximizing the ones you actually can influence and trusting your teammates to handle theirs."

Garrett looked at me, something shifting in his expression. "You're saying I try to control too much."

"I'm saying you can't control whether I place a perfect corner kick. You can control positioning your players to capitalize on it if I do. You can't control whether Connor finishes his chances. You can control delivering him good passes. The rest—" I gestured vaguely, "—you have to let go."

"And if I let go and we lose?"

"Then you lose having done everything you actually could do. Which is different from losing because you didn't try."

He considered this, really considered it, his analytical mind working through the logic. "My dad would disagree with you. He thinks a captain should control everything."

"Can anyone actually control everything in a soccer game?"

"No."

"Then maybe your dad's wrong."

The words hung between us. I half-expected him to get defensive, to shut down the conversation. Instead, Garrett let out a short laugh—genuine, if slightly bitter.

"He's wrong about a lot of things, actually."

The admission felt significant, like he was sharing something real. I waited, sensing there was more if I didn't push.

"He played here," Garrett said after a moment. "And my grandfather. My brother. All of them captains, all of them went on to play college soccer. It's this whole legacy thing." He paused. "My brother got a full ride to a Division I school. My dad talks about it constantly. The expectation is that I'll match that or exceed it."

"That's a lot of weight."

"Yeah. And if I don't..." He trailed off, but I understood. The unspoken consequences of failing to live up to family expectations.

"Is that what the scholarship pressure is about? Living up to your brother?"

"Partly. Also, my family's broke." He said it flatly, matter-of-fact. "We look like old money—the legacy status, the right addresses—but it's all image. We can't afford college without a full ride. This season is literally my only shot."

The honesty stunned me. Garrett, who I'd thought was threatened by me because I challenged his control, was actually terrified of failing under the crushing weight of expectations and financial necessity.

"I need a full scholarship too," I said quietly. "My family's paying what they can for Oakmont, but college has to be fully funded or I don't go."

Garrett met my eyes, and something passed between us. Recognition. We were fighting the same battle from different angles—both desperate to prove ourselves, both carrying pressure that had nothing to do with loving soccer and everything to do with survival.

"So when I joined the team," I said slowly, working through it, "you saw me as a variable you couldn't control. Something that might derail your one shot."

"Yeah." He didn't try to deny it or soften it. "I saw you as a risk."

"And now?"

He was quiet for a beat. "Now I see you as a teammate who makes us better. Someone who actually understands the pressure, not just the game."

It wasn't a flowery declaration. Garrett didn't do flowery. But it was honest, and that mattered more.

"For what it's worth," I said, "I think you're a good captain. Maybe too hard on yourself, but your teammates respect you. They follow your lead."

"Even when I'm wrong? Like the near post call at Worthington?"

"Even then. Because they trust your intentions are about winning, not about ego."

Garrett absorbed this, then gave a small nod. "Thank you."

We sat in comfortable silence, the team's celebration continuing around us. But the bubble of quiet we'd created felt less awkward now, more like natural comfort.

"Can I ask you something?" I said eventually.

"Fair's fair."

"Why did you defend me at dinner last night?"

Garrett glanced at me. "Because Derek was being an ass. The room accommodations aren't your fault. Making you feel bad about logistics is pointless."

"You could have let it slide."

"No. I'm the captain. Part of the job is shutting down that kind of division." He paused. "And honestly? You've handled everything with way more grace than I did. Derek's comments were disrespectful to how hard you've worked."

The acknowledgment settled somewhere warm in my chest. "Thank you."

"I'm just being honest."

We fell quiet again, but this time the silence felt different. Less like maintaining distance and more like two people who'd started to see each other as whole, complicated people instead of obstacles.

The bus rolled on toward Oakmont, carrying a victorious team and two teammates who'd found, against all odds, the beginning of mutual respect.
